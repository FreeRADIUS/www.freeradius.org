		<p>FreeRADIUS was founded in June 1999 by Miquel van Smoorenburg and Alan DeKok. The first public "alpha" release of the code was in August 1999, with 0.1 being released in May 2001. Since then, new versions have been released every few months.</p>

			<h3>FreeRADIUS is used daily by 100 million people to access the Internet.</h3>
			<img src="../img/octo-bright.svg" alt="" class="icon_medium block">
		</div>

		<p>Since then, the project has grown to include support for more authentication types than any other open source server. It is used daily by <a href="#usage_statistics">100 million people</a> to access the Internet. There are over 50 thousand sites using FreeRADIUS, ranging in size from 10 users to over 10 million users.</p>

		<p>Since its founding, the project has expanded to include a number of other <a href="/sub_projects/">RADIUS related products</a>, including:</p>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-client">freeradius-client</a> A BSD licensed RADIUS client library.<br>
		<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/mod_auth_radius">mod_auth_radius</a> A RADIUS module for Apache 1.x and 2.x.<br>
		<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/pam_radius">pam_radius_auth</a> A Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) for RADIUS authenticationand accounting.</p>

				<p>Not everyone uses FreeRADIUS, so we also asked what other RADIUS servers people have used.</p>

				<p>As mentioned above, ACS and IAS have about an equal market share, and together account for about 50% of other servers. Another 40% is shared pretty much equally between a few well-known RADIUS servers. The last 10% is a jumble of old servers (some very old), or servers that are targetted towards niche markets.</p>

				<p>The numbers for Funk and Radiator are probably too low, because the survey was focussed on sites that have chosen to deploy Open Source. For the same reasons mentioned before, we expect that enterprises who have chosen to use a commercial product have also not filled out the survey.</p>

		<p class="small-print text_centered lg_padding_h">The survey was commissioned because RADIUS servers are usally hidden inside of private networks (for very good reasons), and are not publicly accessibly like HTTP or DNS servers. That is, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> can say that it is the number one HTTP server in the Internet because of public results from <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html">Netcraft</a>. In order to get the same data, we have to directly ask site administrators what they are using. The good news is that over 500 responses to the survey were received, with the results as of November 2006 summarized as shown above.</p>
