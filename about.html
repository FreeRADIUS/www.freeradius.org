<h1>About the FreeRADIUS Server Project</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS was founded in June 1999 by Miquel van Smoorenburg and
Alan DeKok.  The first public "alpha" release of the code was in
August 1999, with 0.1 being released in May 2001.  Since then, new
versions have been released every few months.</p>

<p>Since then, the project has grown to include support for more
authentication types than any other open source server.  It is used
daily by <a href="press/survey.html">100 million</a> people to access
the Internet.  There are over 50 thousand sites using
FreeRADIUS, ranging in size from 10 users to over 10 million
users.</p>

<p>Since its founding, the project has expanded to include a number of
other RADIUS <a href="related/">related</a> products, including</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/freeradius-client">freeradius-client</a> A BSD licensed RADIUS client library.</li>

<li><a href="/mod_auth_radius">mod_auth_radius</a> A RADIUS module for Apache 1.x and 2.x.</li>

<li><a href="/pam_radius_auth">pam_radius_auth</a> A Pluggable
Authentication Module (PAM) for RADIUS authentication and accounting.</li>


</ul>
