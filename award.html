  <p>
  For a number of months now, the FreeRADIUS project has been
  collecting funds from the Amazon Associates program, mostly from the
  sales of the <A
  HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596003226/freeradiusorg-20">
  RADIUS book</a>.  Now that we have sufficient funds collected, we
  would like to announce the awards program.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>At the end of every month, we will take the list of people who've
  contributed to the server for that month, and pick one to be the
  <em>contributor of the month</em>.  They would get their choice of
  about $50 towards buying a book of their choice, (from Amazon, using
  the FreeRADIUS associates ID).  The FreeRADIUS Project will take
  care of ordering the book, paying for it, and having Amazon deliver
  it to the award winner.
  </p>

  <p>The winners name, description of their contribution, and some
  more information will be added below, to the <em>Award Winners</em>
  list for posterity.
  </p>

  <p>We expect that the regular developers don't need much
  encouragement, so the chosen contributor would generally be someone
  outside of the regular development team.  This practice encourages
  others to contribute, who may not otherwise have the incentive.
  </p>

  <p>Every month, a goal for that month will be announced.  The goal will
  be something which will move the development and use of the server
  forward.  It may be more documentation. bug fixes, added features,
  or almost anything else.  The winner does not have to contribute to
  that goal in order to receive the award of the month, but the goal
  does help to focus efforts.
  </p>  

  <h2>Goal of the Month</h2>

  <p>For May 2003, the goal is more <em>man</em> pages.  The
  documentation for the modules (<em>rlm_*</em>) is currently in
  various forms in the <tt>doc/</tt> directory.  We need to have these
  files reformatted in a standard manner, updated, and to have more
  documentation added.  This is where you come in.
  </p>

  <p>The steps to acheiving the goal are as follows:

    <ul>
      <li> Download <A HREF="http://mvertes.free.fr/">txt2man</A>,
      which will be used to generate <em>man</em> pages from
      plain-text files.
      </li>
      <li> Pick a file (<em>rlm_*</em>) from the <tt>doc/</tt>
      directory, and email the <a
      href="http://lists.cistron.nl/archives/freeradius-users/">freeradius-users</a>
      list, saying which file you're working on.
      </li>
      <li> Edit the file to follow the format of the <A
      HREF="http://mvertes.free.fr/">txt2man</A> program, and run
      txt2man on it, to be sure that a good <em>man</em> page is
      generated.
      </li>
      <li> If you have any questions, email the <a
      href="http://lists.cistron.nl/archives/freeradius-users/">list</a>.
      </li>
      <li> When you've finished updating the file, email it to the <a
      href="http://lists.cistron.nl/archives/freeradius-users/">list</a>.
      If you are an award winner for that month, you will be
      contacted.
      </li>
    </ul>
