This is the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for the Cistron RADIUS Server
(cistron-radiusd for short) development project. It contains both general and 
technical information about Cistron RADIUS: project status, what it is and 
what it does, how to obtain and configure and run it, and more. Please read 
this FAQ carefully before you post questions about Radiusd to mailing list to 
see if your question is already answered here first. 

That is, PLEASE read the FAQ. Question 4.11, especially, is VERY important.

This FAQ is posted monthly to the following mailing list:

<HR><P><H1>Section 1 - Overview</H1>


<HR><H2><A NAME="1.1">1.1</A>	What is Cistron RADIUS and what is it supposed to do? </H2>

Cistron RADIUS Server or cistron-radiusd is a daemon for un*x operating
systems which allows one to set up (guess what!) a radius protocol server, 
which is usually used for authentication and accounting of dial-up users. 
To use server, you also need a correctly setup client which will talk to it, 
usually a terminal server or a PC with appropriate which emulates it 
(PortSlave, radiusclient etc).

Original author and current maintainer of Cistron RADIUS is Miquel van
Smoorenburg <A HREF="miquels at cistron dot nl">miquels at cistron dot nl</A>.


<HR><H2><A NAME="1.2">1.2</A>	How it differs from other radius servers?</H2>

First of all, Cistron RADIUS is an open-source product, and has all the 
benefits open-source provides.

Also, it has many features not found in free servers and many commercial
ones, like:

	o  Access based on huntgroups
	o  Multiple DEFAULT entries in raddb/users file
	o  All users file entries can optionally "fall through"
	o  Caches all config files in-memory
	o  Keeps a list of logged in users (radutmp file)
	o  "radwho" program can be installed as "fingerd"
	o  Logs both UNIX wtmp file format and RADIUS detail logfiles
	o  Supports Simultaneous-Use = X parameter. Yes, this means that you
  	   can now prevent double logins!
	o  Supports Vendor-Specific attributes, including USR non-standard
	   ones.
	o  Supports proxying
	o  Supports the "Alive" packet
	o  Exec-Program-Wait, allows you to set up an external program which
	   is executed after authentication and outputs a list of A/V pairs
	   which is then added to the reply.
	o  Supports PAM

More information is available in the documentation.


<HR><H2><A NAME="1.3">1.3</A>	On what platforms does it run?</H2>

There are reports of Cistron RADIUS running on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, 
OSF/Unix, Solaris. Porting to other platforms should be easy.


<HR><H2><A NAME="1.4">1.4</A>	Who uses Cistron RADIUS?</H2>

Cistron RADIUS is used by many ISP worldwide and has proven to be a stable
product. The final version of the server is 1.6.

Development has since moved to the FreeRADIUS server.

<HR><P><H1>Section 3 - How to Find, Install, Configure and Cistron RADIUS</H1>


<HR><H2><A NAME="3.1">3.1</A>	Where can I get Cistron RADIUS?</H2>

You can find it, along with some useful links and documentation, at official
Cistron RADIUS WWW site at 

	<A HREF="http://www.radius.cistron.nl/">http://www.radius.cistron.nl/</A>
	
Sources are available at

<H3><A NAME="3.1.1">3.1.1</A>	Are there RPM packages of Cistron RADIUS?</H3>

Yes. RPM and SRPM packages are provided by Mauricio Andrade 
<A HREF="mandrade at mma dot com dot br">mandrade at mma dot com dot br</A> and can be found at:

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.mma.com.br/pub/cistron-radius-RPMS">ftp://ftp.mma.com.br/pub/cistron-radius-RPMS</A>

<HR><H2><A NAME="3.2">3.2</A>	How do I install Cistron RADIUS?</H2>

	bash$ tar zxvf radiusd-cistron-[version].tar.gz
	bash$ cd src

copy the appropriate Makefile.xxx for your OS to Makefile

	bash$ [vi|emacs|pico|whatever] Makefile
	bash$ make
	bash$ su - root
	bash# make install

And don't forget to read supplied documentation first.

Also, you can get pre-compiled versions of Cistron RADIUS for different
platforms, links are available at the official WWW site.


<HR><H2><A NAME="3.3">3.3</A>	Is there a way to bind Cistron RADIUS to a specific IP address?</H2>

Yes - see the manual page. You can specify an IP address to bind to with the
-i ipaddr command line option.


<HR><H2><A NAME="3.4">3.4</A>	Can I run Cistron RADIUS under daemontools control?</H2>

Yes, you can. Assuming you already have daemontools installed, configured and
running in your system (see <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html</A>), you will
have to make two decisions: 

	o 	The log account and group name (I use log.log in this example). 
		Logging programs run under this account.group. If this 
		account.group pair do not exist yet, create it now.

	o 	The radiusd local service directory (I use /etc/radiusd in 
		this example). This is where radiusd will store logs and a 
		few configuration files. 

Here are the steps I did (just once):

	bash# groupadd log
	bash# useradd -g log log
	bash# mkdir /etc/radiusd
	bash# mkdir /etc/radiusd/log
	bash# mkdir /etc/radiusd/log/main
	bash# chmod +t+s /etc/radiusd /etc/radiusd/log
	bash# chown log.log /etc/radiusd/log/main

The supervise program starts radiusd by running a shell script called "run"
from /etc/radiusd. Here are the contents of /etc/radiusd/run:

	bash# cd /etc/radiusd
	bash# cat run
	#!/bin/sh
	exec 2&gt;&amp;1
	exec /usr/sbin/radiusd -fyz -lstderr

It is important to add -f and -l stderr to argument list of radiusd or svc
and logging functions will not work properly.

The logging feature is also started by a "run" script. This one is located in
/etc/radiusd/log. Here are the contents of /etc/radiusd/log/run
 
	bash# cd /etc/radiusd/log
	bash# cat run
	#!/bin/sh
	exec setuidgid log multilog t ./main

To make service starts do (just once):

	bash# ln -sf /etc/radiusd /service

Now you can send signals to radiusd using the svc program. Here are some 
interesting ones:

To hang-up it (reload config) do:
	
	bash# svc -h /service/radiusd

To temporarly disable it (down) do:

	bash# svc -d /service/radiusd

To reenable it (up) do:

	bash# svc -u /service/radius


<HR><P><H1>Section 4 - Common problems and their solutions</H1>


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.1">4.1</A>	3Com/USR HiPerArc doesn't work.</H2>

I'm using a 3Com/USR HiPerArc and I keep getting this message on
radius.log:

| Mon Jul 26 15:18:54 1999: Error: Accounting: logout: entry for NAS
| tc-if5 port 1 has wrong ID

What should I do to get rid of these messages?

You are using HiPer ARC 4.1.11, right? Version 4.1.11 has a problem
reporting NAS-port numbers to Radius. Upgrade the firmware from

	<A HREF="http://totalservice.usr.com">http://totalservice.usr.com</A>

to at least 4.1.59. If you are in Europe you can telephone to 3Com Global
Response Center (phone number: 800 879489), and tell them that you have
bought it in the last 90 days. They will help you, step by step, to do the
upgrade.


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.2">4.2</A>	Simultaneous-Use doesn't work.</H2>

Here is a check list:

	1) Check that you added your NAS to raddb/naslist and selected correct
   	   NAS type. Also check raddb/naspasswd.

	2) Run radiusd -sx and see if it parses the Simultaneous-Use line.

	3) Try to run radcheck.pl manually; maybe you may have a wrong version
	    of perl, don't have cmu-snmp installed etc.

The radius server calls the checkrad script when it thinks the user is already
logged on on one or more other ports/terminal servers to verify that the user
is indeed still online on that *other* port/server. If Simultaneous-Use &gt; 1,
then it might be that checkrad is called several times to verify each existing
session.

This method successfully prevents a user from logging in multiple times across
multiple NAS boxes.


<H3><A NAME="4.2.1">4.2.1</A>	3Com/USR HiPerArc Simultaneous-Use doesn't work.</H3>

by Robert Dalton <A HREF="support at accesswest dot com">support at accesswest dot com</A>

Verify if you are using HiPerArc software version V4.2.32 release date
09/09/99

In order for simultaneous logins to be prevented reported port
density must be set to 256  using the command :

	set pbus reported_port_density 256

Otherwise it changes the calculations of the SNMP object ID's.

There is a bug in effected versions of checkrad namely the line under the
subroutine "sub_usrhiper". The line that should be commented out is:

	($login) = /^.*\"([^"]+)".*$/;


<H3><A NAME="4.2.2">4.2.2</A>	Cisco Simultaneous-Use doesn't work.</H3>

Q: I am getting the following in radius.log file:

Thu Oct 21 10:59:01 1999: Error: Check-TS: timeout waiting for checkrad

What's wrong?

A: Verify if you have SNMP enabled on your CISCO router, check the 
existence of the following line:

	snmp-server community public RO 97

where 97 is the access-list that specifies who gets access to the 
SNMP info. You should also have a line like this:

	access-list 97 permit A.B.C.D

where A.B.C.D is the ip address of the host running the radius server.


<H3><A NAME="4.2.3">4.2.3</A>	Ascend MAX 4048 Simultaneous-Use doesn't work.</H3>

Q: I am getting the following in radius.log file:

Thu Oct 21 10:59:01 1999: Error: Check-TS: timeout waiting for checkrad

What's wrong?

A: Verify that you have the MAX 4048 setup in your naslist as max40xx
and that you have Finger turned on.

	Ethernet-&gt;Mod Config-&gt;Finger=Yes


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.3">4.3</A>	Where is the program to kick users offline using radius?</H2>

It's impossible to do using radius, as radius doesn't do that.

However, Jason Straight wrote a program called radkill, which does just that: 
radkill is a TCL program for Cistron RADIUS users that monitors ISP users'
online times and disconnects them if they are over their call limit. It also 
monitors the number of users online and will disconnect the users with the 
least time left to always keep lines open. It's very configurable for multiple 
NAS setups.

The source archive is available for download at

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.nmo.net/pub/radkill/radkill-latest.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.nmo.net/pub/radkill/radkill-latest.tar.gz</A>

If that doesn't work, try using SNMP.


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.4">4.4</A>	PAP authentication works but CHAP fails</H2>
 
You're not using plaintext passwords in the raddb/users file.
According to Miquel van Smoorenburg in message
<A HREF="mailto:7pcrpn$qi$1@defiant.cistron.net">7pcrpn$qi$1@defiant.cistron.net</A> on cistron-radius:
 
The CHAP protocol requires a plaintext password on the radius server side,
for PAP it doesn't matter.
 
So, if you're using CHAP, for each user entry you must use:

	Auth-Type = Local, Password = "stealme"
 
If you're using only PAP, you can get away with:

	Auth-Type = System
 
or anything else that tickles your fancy.


4.4.1 But CHAP is more secure, isn't it?

Not really.

Q: Does Section 4.4 really mean I must leave a file lying around with
   cleartext passwords for the more than 400 people who'll be using this
   thing?

A: Yes.

So what do ISP with (tens of?) thousands of customers do?

You have 2 choices:

1. You allow CHAP and store all the passwords plaintext.
   Advantage: passwords don't go cleartext over the phone line between
   the user and the terminal server. Disadvantage: You have to
   store the passwords in cleartext on the server.

2. You don't allow CHAP, just PAP. Advantage: you don't store
   cleartext passwords on your system. Disadvantage: passwords go
   in cleartext over the phone line between the user and the terminal server.

Now, people say CHAP is more secure. Now you decide which is more likely:

- the phone line between the user and the terminal server gets sniffed
  and a cracker (a GOOD one) intercepts just one password
- your radius server is hacked into and a cracker gets ALL passwords
  of ALL users.

Right. Still think CHAP is more secure ? I thought so.

This is a limitation of the CHAP protocol itself, not the RADIUS
protocol. The CHAP protocol *requires* that you store the passwords in
plain-text format.


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.5">4.5</A>	Incoming Authentication-Request passwords are all garbage. Why?</H2>

The shared secret is incorrect. This is a text string which is a "secret" (in
the raddb/clients file) shared by both the NAS and the server. It is used to
authenticate and to encrypt/decrypt packets.

Run the server in debugging mode:

	radiusd -xxyz -l stdout

The first password you see will be in a RADIUS attribute: 

	Password = "dsa2\2223jdfjs"'

The second password will be in a log message, e.g.:

	Login failed [user/password] ...

If the text AFTER the slash is garbage then the shared secret is wrong. Delete
it on BOTH the NAS and the raddb/clients file and re-enter it. Do NOT check to
see if they are the same, as there may be hidden spaces or other characters.

Another cause of garbage passwords being logged is the secret being too long.
Certain NAS boxes have limitations on the length of the secret and don't
complain about it. Cistron RADIUS is limited to 16 characters for the shared
secret.


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.6">4.6</A>	What's with the commas in the raddb/users file?</H2>

Harry Hinteman <A HREF="Harry at staffassoc dot com">Harry at staffassoc dot com</A> wrote:
&gt; Can anyone give me a quick lesson on what the commas do in the users file,
&gt; and how you know when to use them and when you don't .

Commas link lists of attributes together. The general format for a raddb/users
file entry is:

	name    Check-Item = Value, ..., Check-Item = Value
		Reply-Item = Value,
		.
        	.
        	.
        	Reply-Item = Value

Where the dots means repetition of attributes.

The first line contains check-items ONLY. Commas go BETWEEN check-items. The
first line ends WITHOUT a comma.

The next number of lines are reply-items ONLY. Commas go BETWEEN reply-items.
The last line of the reply-item list ends WITHOUT a comma.

Check-items are used to match attributes in a request packet or to set server
parameters. Reply-items are used to set attributes which are to go in the reply
packet. So things like Simultaneous-Use go on the first line of a raddb/users
file entry and Framed-IP-Address goes on any following line.


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.7">4.7</A>	The server is complaining about invalid user route-bps-asc1-1,</H2>
	along with lots of others. Why?

Ascend decided to have the 4000 series NAS boxes retrieve much of their
configuration from the RADIUS server. See:

	<A HREF="http://www.freeradius.org/references/ascend-filter.html">http://www.freeradius.org/references/ascend-filter.html</A>


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.8">4.8</A>	The NAS seems to ignore the reply of the radius server. Why?</H2>

Symptom: you are seeing lots of duplicate requests in radius.log, yet users
can not login, and/or you are seeing duplicated accounting messages (up to 50
times the same accounting record as if the NAS doesn't realize you received the
packet).

Perhaps your server has multiple IP addresses, perhaps even multiple network
cards. If a request comes in on IP address a.b.c.d but the server replies with
as source IP address w.x.y.z most NAS won't accept the answer.

The simplest solution is to modify the startup script and add the -i address
option to the radiusd command line. This will bind the server to specifically
that IP address. It will only listen to that address and replies will always go
out with that address as the source address.

<HR><H2><A NAME="4.9">4.9</A>	Why Cistron RADIUS is taking so long to start?</H2>

This is generally caused by an incorrect named configuration. Check your named
files and look for invalid entries. 

Another file to investigate is raddb/naslist. All entries there must be
resolved by a DNS query. 


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.10">4.10</A>	Why radwho is taking so long to show users connected?</H2>

See question 4.9

<HR><H2><A NAME="4.11">4.11</A>	What does "Error: Accounting: logout: ..." mean?</H2>

First, some background.

The server keeps a session database of active sessions in the
radutmp file. When a user logs in, the NAS sends a radius accounting
start packet with info such as username, IP address and a unique
session-id for this session. The server then adds this session to
the list of active sessions.

When the user logs out, the NAS sends a radius accounting stop message
with mostly the same info as in the start packet and things like
the total session-time. The server then deletes the session from the
list of active sessions.

This message:

    Error: Accounting: logout: entry for NAS <A HREF="x">x</A> port &lt;y&gt; has wrong ID

means that a radius stop record was received for a certain NAS and
NAS-Port, but that the session-id in the session database (radutmp)
didn't match up with the one in the accounting stop record.

This messageL

    Error: Accounting: logout: login entry for NAS <A HREF="x">x</A> port &lt;y&gt; not found

means that a radius stop record was received for a session for which
the server never saw a start record. This can happen for example when
you delete the /var/log/radutmp file, or when it gets damaged.

These messages are mostly harmless.


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.12">4.12</A>	It still doesn't work!</H2>

Stop right there.  Before going any further, be sure that you have
included the following items in your request for help:

	o  relevant portion from the raddb/users file
	o  debugging output (using flags -xxyz -l stdout) from radiusd
	o  output from radtest, when run on the same machine as radiusd

Too many people post questions saying "something's wrong, how do I
fix it?" with NO background information. This is worse than useless,
it's annoying.

Now that you have prepared all the information, post your question to the
cistron-radius mailing list:

	<A HREF="http://lists.cistron.nl/mailman/listinfo/cistron-radius">http://lists.cistron.nl/mailman/listinfo/cistron-radius</A>


<HR><H2><A NAME="4.13">4.13</A>	Debugging it yourself.</H2>

If you're REALLY interested in knowing how to debug the RADIUS server
yourself, then the following steps will help you:

1. Run the server in debugging mode

	radiusd -sfxxyz -l stdout

2. The server SHOULD print out:

	Ready to process requests.

If it doesn't, then it should print out an error message. Read it.

If it takes a long time to start up, and THEN prints out the message, then your
DNS is broken.  See Q 4.9


3. Ensure that you have localhost in your raddb/clients file. Cistron RADIUS
comes configured this way, so it should be there.

4. Ensure you have a valid user in your raddb/users file. If everything else
fails, go to the top of the file and add the following entry:

	bob  	Password = "bob"
		Reply-Message = "Hello, bob"

5. Run the radtest program from the LOCAL machine, in another window. This will
tell you if the server is alive and is answering requests.

	radtest bob bob localhost 0 testing123

6. Ensure that you see the Reply-Message above and that you do NOT see an
"Access denied" message. If you get an Access-Accept message, this means that
the server is running properly.

7. Configure another machine as a RADIUS client and run radtest from that
machine too. You SHOULD see the server receive the request and send a reply.
	     
If the server does NOT receive the request then the ports are confused. RADIUS
historically uses 1645/UDP, where RFC 2138 and many new systems use the proper
value of 1812/UDP. See /etc/services or use the -p option to specify a different
port.

Run tcpdump in another window on the RADIUS client machine. Use the command:

	tcpdump udp

Look CAREFULLY at the packets coming from the RADIUS server. Which address are
they coming from? Which port?

8. If authentication works from a different machine then you have the server
set up correctly.

9. Now you should use a more complicated configuration to see if the server
receives and replies with the attributes you want. There is little information
that can be offered here in the FAQ as your individual systems configuration can
not be predicted.

However, a few hints can help:

1. ALWAYS test your configurations running the server in debugging mode

	radiusd -xxyz -l stdout

if you want to debug a problem. If you do not do so then DO NOT expect anyone
else to be able to help you.

2. Read RFC 2138 to see what the RADIUS attributes are and how they work.

3. ALWAYS starts with a simple configuration in place of a more complicated one.
You should not expect to be able to debug a complicated configuration entry by
sending one packet, and looking at the trace.

Make the configuration as simple as possible, EVEN IF it doesn't do exactly
what you want. Then, repeatedly, try to authenticate and see if it works. If
authentication succeeds, then you can gradually add more attributes to the
configuration to get the entry you desire.


<HR><P><H1>Section 5 - How do I ... ?</H1>


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.1">5.1</A>	How do I send a message to PPP users?</H2>

On Windows, the short answer is that you don't.

RADIUS defines a Reply-Message attribute, which you can often use to
send text messages in a RADIUS reply packet.  PPP has provisions for
passing text messages back to the user.

Unfortunately, Microsoft decided to ignore that part of the PPP
protocol.  So you CAN send messages to Windows PPP users.  But Windows
will throw the message away, and never show it to the user.

If you don't like this behaviour, call Microsoft and complain.

On the Mac side, the only dialer that shows up the server's message 
is FreePPP <A HREF="http://www.rockstar.com">http://www.rockstar.com</A>.


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.2">5.2</A>	How do I deny access to a specific user, or group of users?</H2>

You need to use the Group check item to match a group. You also need to use the
Auth-Type = Reject check item to deny them access. A short message explaining
why they were rejected wouldn't hurt, so a Reply-Message reply attribute would
be nice. This rule needs to match for all users, so it should be a DEFAULT
entry. You want to apply it *instead* of any other authentication type, so it
should be listed BEFORE any other entry which contains an Auth-Type. It doesn't
need a Fall-Through, because you're not giving the user any permission to do any
thing, you're just rejecting them.

The following entry denies access to one specific user. Note that it MUST be put
before ANY other entry with an Auth-Type attribute.

	foo	Auth-Type = Reject
		Reply-Msg = "foo is not allowed to dial-in"

The following entry denies access to a group of users. The same restrictions as
above on location in the raddb/users file also apply:

	DEFAULT	Group = "disabled", Auth-Type = Reject
		Reply-Message = "Your account has been disabled"


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.3">5.3</A>	How do I use Login-Time for groups, not for users?</H2>

Limit logons between 08:00am and 08:00pm for Unix group "daysonly"

	DEFAULT Group = "daysonly", Login-Time = "0800-2000"
or
	DEFAULT Group = "daysonly", Login-Time = "Any0800-2000"

Limit logons between 08:00am and 08:00pm, from Monday to Friday 
for Unix group "weekdays"

	DEFAULT Group = "weekdays", Login-Time = "Wk0800-2000"

Limit logons between 08:00am and 08:00pm, in Saturday and Sunday 
for Unix group "weekends"

	DEFAULT Group = "weekends", Login-Time = "Sa-Su0800-2000"


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.4">5.4</A>	How do I enable Cistron RADIUS to log accounting attribute type X?</H2>

You can't. A RADIUS server will only log the messages which a NAS
sends to it. If your NAS is not sending those messages or attributes,
then the RADIUS server will not log them.

You must configure your NAS to send the information you want to the
RADIUS server. Once the NAS is sending the information, the server
can then log it.


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.5">5.5</A>	How do I permit access to any user regardless of password?</H2>

	DEFAULT	Auth-Type = Accept


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.6">5.6</A>	How do I limit access to only POP3 and SMTP?</H2>

Q: I need to limit some users to be able only to use our POP3 and SMTP server.

The most common approach is to just assign non-globally-routable IP addresses to
those users, such as RFC1918 addresses. Depending on your internal network
configuration, you may need to set up internal routes for those addresses, and
if you don't want them to do anything besides SMTP and POP3 within your network,
you'll have to set up ACLs on your dialup interfaces allowing only ports 25 and
110 through. 

Make sure you have RADIUS authorization enabled on your NAS.

Example user entry in raddb/users file:

	foo	Auth-Type=System
		Framed-Filter-Id="160.in"
		Framed-Filter-Id="161.out"
		Fall-Through=Yes

CISCO's config must have:

	aaa authorization network default radius
	ip access-list extended 160
	permit ip ...
	ip access-list extended 161
	permit ip ...

The access list 160 gets applied on inbound packets and 161 on 
outbound packets.


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.7">5.7</A>	How do I use PAM with Cistron RADIUS?</H2>

You'll need the redhat/radiusd.pam file from the distribution. It should go
into a new file, /etc/pam.d/radius.

If you have 100's to 1000's of users in /etc/passwd, you'll want to replace
the pam_pwdb.so entries with pam_unix_auth.so, pam_unix_acct.so etc. The
pam_pwdb module is INCREDIBLY SLOW for authenticating users from a large
/etc/passwd file.
  
Bruno Lopes F. Cabral <A HREF="bruno at openline dot com dot br">bruno at openline dot com dot br</A> also says:

Now I can emulate group behaviour using just PAM and some tricks, like

	#-----
	auth	required /lib/security/pam_userdb.so \
		crypt db=/etc/raddb/data/users
	auth	required /lib/security/pam_listfile.so \
		item=user sense=allow \
		file=/etc/raddb/data/somehunt.allow onerr=fail
	auth	required /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
	account	required /lib/security/pam_userdb.so
	#-----

and

	DEFAULT	Huntgroup-Name="somehunt", \
		Auth-Type=PAM, \
		Pam-Auth="radhunt", \
 		Simultaneous-Use=1
        	Fall-Through = Yes

this way I have NO users on /etc/password and NO need for lots of lines
on /etc/raddb/users. time to search for a db enabled pam_listfile module ;&gt;


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.8">5.8</A>	How do I get radius to pick up changes in the raddb/users file?</H2>

The server reads the config files just once, at startup. This is very efficient,
but you need to tell the server somehow to re-read its config files after you
made a change. This can be done by sending the server a SIGHUP (signal '1' on
almost if not all UNIX systems). The server writes its PID in
/var/run/radiusd.pid, so a simple UNIX command to do this would be:

	kill -1 `cat /var/run/radiusd.pid`

Some people would be tempted to do this every 5 minutes so that changes come
through automatically. That is not a good idea as it might take some time to
re-read the config files and the server may drop a few authentication requests
at that time. A better idea is to use a so-called "timestamp file" and only send
a SIGHUP if the raddb/users file changed since the last time. For example a
script like this, to be run every 5 minutes:

	#! /bin/sh
	cd /etc/raddb
	if [ ! -e .last-reload ] || [ "`find users -nt .last-reload`" ]; then
		if radiusd -C &gt; .last-reload 2&gt;&amp;1; then
			kill -1 `cat /var/run/radiusd.pid`
		else
			mail -s "radius reload failed!" root &lt; .last-reload
		fi
	fi
	touch .last-reload

Note that you need at least 1.6.4 for the radiusd -C invocation to work.

Of course a Makefile is suited perfectly for this kind of stuff.


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.9">5.9</A>	How do I check the configuration before sending a HUP to the server?</H2>

Some administrators have automated scripts to update the radius servers
configuration files. The server can then be signalled via a HUP signal to
re-read the configuration files.

The problem with this approach is that any syntax errors in the configuration
file may cause your main radius server to die! No one wants this to happen so
there should be some process of checking the configuration files prior to
re-starting the server.

For versions prior to 1.6.4, you can use the following script:

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/contrib/check-radiusd-config.sh">ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/contrib/check-radiusd-config.sh</A>

With 1.6.4 and later, you can simply use

	radiusd -C

to check the configuration. It will print the status and exit with a zero exit
status if everything is fine or with a non-zero exit status if errors were found
in the configuration.

In the example script in the paragraph above this has already been used.


<HR><H2><A NAME="5.10">5.10</A>	How do I tell the user what to use for an IP netmask?</H2>

The whole netmask business is a complicated one. An IP interface has
an IP address and usually a netmask associated with it. Netmasks on
point-to-point interfaces like a PPP link are generally not used.

If you set the Framed-IP-Netmask attribute in a radius profile, you
are setting the netmask of the interface on the side of the NAS.
The Framed-IP-Netmask attribute is NOT something you can set to
influence the netmask on the side of the dialin user. And usually,
that makes no sense anyway even if you could set it.

The result of this on most NASes is that they start to route a
subnet (the subnet that contains the assigned IP address and that
is as big as the netmask indicates) to that PPP interface and thus
to the user. If that is exactly what you want, then that's fine,
but if you do not intend to route a whole subnet to the user,
then by all means do NOT use the Framed-IP-Netmask attribute.

Almost (all?) NASes interpret a left-out Framed-IP-Netmask as if
it was set to 255.255.255.255. So if you somehow feel a certain
need to set the Framed-IP-Netmask to anything, set it to
255.255.255.255.

For example, the following entries do almost the same on most NASes:

	user	Auth-Type = Local, Password = "blegh"
		Service-Type = Framed-User,
		Framed-Protocol = PPP,
		Framed-IP-Address = 192.168.5.78,
		Framed-IP-Netmask = 255.255.255.240

	user	Auth-Type = Local, Password = "blegh"
		Service-Type = Framed-User,
		Framed-Protocol = PPP,
		Framed-IP-Address = 192.168.5.78,
		Framed-Route = "192.168.5.64/28 0.0.0.0 1"

The result is that the end user gets IP address 192.168.5.78 and that
the whole network with IP addresses 192.168.5.64 - 195.64.5.79 is
routed over the PPP link to the user (see the Radius RFCs for the
exact syntax of the Framed-Route attribute).
