     2.  Abstract

     This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS account-
     ing client functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Man-
     agement Information Base (MIB) for use with network management  proto-
     cols  in the Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based man-
     agement stations can manage RADIUS accounting clients.


     3.  Introduction

     This memo defines a portion of the Management Information  Base  (MIB)
     for  use  with network management protocols in the Internet community.
     In particular, it describes managed objects used for  managing  RADIUS
     accounting clients.

     Today  a  wide  range of network devices, including routers and NASes,
     act as RADIUS accounting clients in order to provide  accounting  ser-
     vices.   As  a  result,  the effective management of RADIUS accounting
     clients is of considerable importance.

     4.  The SNMP Management Framework

     The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major  compo-
     nents:

         o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

         o   Mechanisms  for  describing  and naming objects and events for
             the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure
             of  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described
             in RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC  1215  [4].  The  second
             version,  called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903
             [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

         o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
             first  version  of  the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1
             and described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version  of  the  SNMP
             message  protocol,  which  is  not an Internet standards track
             protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9]  and
             RFC  1906  [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
             called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10],  RFC  2272  [11]
             and RFC 2274 [12].

         o   Protocol  operations for accessing management information. The
             first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
             described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
             and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

         o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC  2273  [14]
             and  the  view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
             2275 [15].

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information  store,  termed
     the  Management  Information  Base  or  MIB.   Objects  in the MIB are
     defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
     conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate trans-
     lations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent,
     except  where  objects or events are omitted because no translation is
     possible (use of Counter64).  Some  machine  readable  information  in
     SMIv2  will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the
     translation process. However, this loss of machine  readable  informa-
     tion is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


     5.  Overview

     The  RADIUS  accounting  protocol,  described  in  [16], distinguishes
     between the  client  function  and  the  server  function.  In  RADIUS
     accounting,  clients  send Accounting-Requests, and servers reply with
     Accounting-Responses. Typically NAS devices implement the client func-
     tion,  and  thus  would be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting
     client MIB, while  RADIUS  accounting  servers  implement  the  server



     Aboba & Zorn                 Informational                    [Page 2]

     function,  and thus woud be expected o implement the RADIUS accounting
     server MIB.

     However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to perform both
     client  and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a
     server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while  simultaneously
     acting  as an accounting client to one or more accounting servers.  In
     such situations, it is expected that RADIUS entities combining  client
     and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.


     5.1.  Selected objects
     This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Accounting Server Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS server that the client shares a secret with.

     Each entry in the RADIUS Accounting  Server  Table  includes  thirteen
     columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS client.

     8.  Security considerations

     There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have  a  MAX-
     ACCESS  clause  of  read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
     implemented correctly, then there is no  risk  that  an  intruder  can
     alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP SET
     opertions.

     There are a number of managed objects in this  MIB  that  may  contain
     sensitive information. These are:

     radiusAccServerAddress
               This  can  be  used  to  determine the address of the RADIUS
               accounting server with which the  client  is  communicating.
               This  information  could  be useful in mounting an attack on
               the acounting server, which may contain sensitive  financial
               data.

     radiusAccClientServerPortNumber
               This  can  be used to determine the port number on which the
               RADIUS accounting client is sending. This information  could
               be  useful  in  impersonating  the  client  in order to send
               fraudulent data to the accounting server.

     It is thus important to control even GET access to these  objects  and
     possibly  to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
     over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide  features
     for such a secure environment.

     SNMPv1  by  itself  is  not  a secure environment. Even if the network
     itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control  as
     to  who  on  the  secure  network  is  allowed  to  access and GET/SET
     (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

     It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
     as  provided  by  the  SNMPv3  framework. Specifically, the use of the
     User-based Security Model RFC 2274  [12]  and  the  View-based  Access

     INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Accounting Client MIB     11 November 1998


     Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.  Using these security fea-
     tures,  customer/users can give access to the objects  only  to  those
     principals   (users)  that  have  legitimate  rights  to  GET  or  SET
     (change/create/delete) them.
