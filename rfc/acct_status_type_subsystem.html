<H1>Acct-Status-Type and Subsystems</H1>

<p>This page discusses problems with standards and our recommended
solutions.  These recommendations do not update or modify any existing
standards.  However, we believe that the recommendations are generally
useful to the RADIUS community.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>The Acct-Status-Type attribute has only a few values defined. These
values do not fully match new practices in RADIUS. In particular, some
wireless access points are composed of multiple subsystems. For
example, an access point may have a controller that manages all
network traffic, and multiple Basic Service Sets on multiple radios in
physically remote locations. This design has a number of practical
benefits, and causes at least one open problem with RADIUS.
</p>

<p>The problem is that a basic service set may come online or go
offline, which causes a loss of connectivity for multiple users.  The
NAS would like to indicate to the RADIUS server that multiple users
are offline.  However, sending one accounting packet for each user is
not scalable.</p>

<p>Some implementations send an accounting packet,
with <code>Acct-Status-Type = Accounting-On</code>, to indicate that the
subsystem has rebooted.  The problem is that RFC 2866 is largely
silent on what constitutes a "session".  The question for the RADIUS
server is "which users, if any, should be marked 'offline' when
receiving such a packet?"</p>

<p>Since RFC 2866 is silent on the subject of session identification
attributes, there is no possible answer to this question.  Every NAS
and/or RADIUS server implementation is free to do something different.
Such choices are bad for inter-operability.</p>

<p>There is an RFC
Editor <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=4485">errata</a>
filed for this problem statement.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>We have a number of recommendations.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Acct-Status-Type = Accounting-On</code> should not be used to indicate sub-system reboot.</li>

<li>IANA should allocate two new values
for <code>Acct-Status-Type</code>: <code>Subsystem-On</code>,
and <code>Subsystem-Off</code>.  These values have meaning similar
to <code>Accounting-On</code> and <code>Accounting-Off</code>, except that they apply to a
subystem of the NAS.</li>

<li>NASes should use these new values to indicate subsystem on/off.</li>

<li>The <code>Called-Station-Id</code> attribute should contain values
unique to each subsystem.</li>

<li>The NAS should signal that the entire system has rebooted by using
the existing <code>Accounting-On</code> and <code>Accounting-Off</code> values, with a value
for <code>Called-Station-Id</code> that is global to the NAS, or to omit it entirely.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two recommendations are unfortunately imprecise, as we
wish to maintain compatibility with existing systems.</p>

<p>One method of implementing them is to put the BSSID and SSID into
the <code>Called-Station-Id</code> attribute.  When the entire NAS
reboots, the <code>Called-Station-Id</code> attribute can be omitted
entirely.</p>
