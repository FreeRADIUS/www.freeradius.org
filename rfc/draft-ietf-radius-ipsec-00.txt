Abstract

   The RADIUS Authentication/Authorization protocol defines  a  mechanism
   which is used by a Network Access Server (NAS) to authenticate dial-up
   users. IP Security defines a mechanism of establishing a  secure  link
   between two entities over a network.

   This document defines a mechanism for RADIUS to inform the NAS of  the
   security policies required for secure communication with a host.

1.0 Introduction

   RADIUS is widely used as a mechanism to send  to  the  NAS  connection
   information.  This  is  particularly important for "login" or tunneled
   users, where the NAS initiates a connection to  a  specified  host  on
   behalf of the user [1][2]. However the only current security mechanism
   used to secure the connection is to rely  on  the  source  IP  address
   (which is a very weak protection).

   The IP Security (IPSEC) protocol suite is used by entities in order to
   communicate  in  a  secure fashion over an untrusted network. In order
   for the NAS to be able to establish a secure link with  a  destination
   host  or  network it requires a set of security policies which defines
   the target as well as the different transforms which are  to  be  used
   during  the communication. These policies need to be pre-configured on
   the NAS prior to establishing the secure link.

   Since particular users can connect to a  variety  of  hosts  over  the
   internet,  it  becomes  very  difficult  to statically configure these
   policies for every host which  dial-up  users  may  connect  to.  This
   document  defines  new  RADIUS attributes which are used to "download"
   security policies for the host which the user may connect to.

2.0  Operation

   In this section we will examine two possible types of  users.  In  the
   first  example  we  will  describe  a  login user, and the second will
   define how a tunneled user would  use  the  extensions  used  in  this
   document.

2.1  Login User

   In this section we will look an at example of a login user. The  user,
   named  joe,  dials  into  a  NAS which authenticates the user with the
   assistance of a local RADIUS Server.  The  user's  RADIUS  profile  is
   shown below:

      joe     Password = password
              Service-Type = Login,
              Login-Service = Telnet,
              Login-IP-Host = 10.1.1.1,
              Login-Port = 23

   As the user's profile depicts, once the user is authenticated the  NAS
   will  create a telnet session to target host 10.1.1.1 on behalf of the
   user. In this case the NAS is used as a terminal server and sends  all
   of  the  user's  asynchronous data to the target encapsulated within a
   telnet session.

                                       +-----+
                                       |     |
                                    +--| RAD |
       +-----+            +-----+   |  |     |
       |     |    PSTN    |     |   |  +-----+
       | Joe |------------| NAS |---|
       |     |            |     |   |
       +-----+            +-----+   |  +-----+
                                    |  |     |
                                    +--|Targ.|
                                       |     |
                                  IP   +-----+

   As stated above IPSEC is a mechanism used by the NAS and the target to
   establish  a  secure telnet connection for the user. Traditionally the
   NAS must have security policies defined locally which state  that  all
   communication  with  the target host for the user must be secured, and
   more importantly how secure the communication must be.


2.2  Tunneled User

   Document [3] defines a protocol which is used by a NAS to "tunnel" all
   PPP  data  from  the user to a destination host. This encapsulation is

   done in order to allow a user to connect to a destination network from
   the internet as well as to allow multi-protocol over an IP network.

   Document [2] defines RADIUS attributes which  may  be  sent  from  the
   RADIUS  Server to the NAS which contain tunneling information, such as
   the target tunnel endpoint.

   In this example we will examine a user named bill which dials  into  a
   NAS  which  authenticates  the  user  using a local RADIUS Server. The
   RADIUS Server informs the NAS that tunneling must occur for  the  user
   as shown in the user's profile below.

      bill    Password = password
              Service-Type = Framed,
              Framed-Protocol = PPP,
              Framed-IP-Netmask = 255.255.255.255,
              Framed-MTU = 1500,
              Framed-IP-Address = 2.3.4.5 ,
              Tunnel-Type = L2TP,
              Tunnel-Medium-Type = IP,
              Tunnel-Server-Endpoint = 10.1.1.2,
              Tunnel-Password = password

   As the user's profile states, once the user is authenticated  the  NAS
   will  create  an L2TP tunnel with the target tunnel endpoint 10.1.1.2.
   Once the tunnel is established all PPP traffic  will  be  encapsulated
   and forwarded to the target.

                                  IP   +-----+

   As stated above IPSEC is a mechanism used by the NAS and the target to
   establish  a  secure  tunnel  for the user. Traditionally the NAS must
   have  security  policies  defined  locally  which   state   that   all
   communication  with  the target host for the user must be secured, and
   more importantly how secure the communication must be.


3.0 Policy Building



Vakil, Calhoun             expires May 1998                      [Page 5]



INTERNET DRAFT                                              November 1997


   This section will define how Policies are built, and most  importantly
   why this is so complex.

   ISAKMP has the ability for an initiator to offer  multiple  protection
   suites  (a.k.a.  proposals),  with preferences associated to them. The
   idea is that the peer has the  ability  to  choose  from  one  of  the
   proposals  offerred.  In  addition  it  is  possible for a proposal to
   contain more than one transform for a given protocol (analogous  to  a
   sub-proposal defined below) which the peer can use.

   The following is an example of a complex, yet valid ISAKMP proposal:


               +-- Protection Suite 1 --+
               |               +-----+  |
               |           +---|SHA-1|  |
               |   +----+  |   +-----+  |
               | +-| AH |--+ OR         |
               | | +----+  |   +-----+  |
               | |         +---| MD5 |  |
         +-----|-+ AND         +-----+  |
         |     | |                      |
         |     | | +----+   +-----+     |
         |     | +-| ESP|---| DES |     |
         |     |   +----+   +-----+     |
         |     +------------------------+
     +---+ OR
         |
         |     +-- Protection Suite 2 --+
         |     |   +----+   +-----+     |
         +-----|---| ESP|---| 3DES|     |
               |   +----+   +-----+     |
               +------------------------+

   In this scenario a requestor proposes two different protection suites,
   one  which  consists  of  both  AH  and  ESP, however note that the AH
   proposal can use either SHA-1 OR MD5 (note that a preference would  be
   assigned to them). In addition ESP must be used with DES.

   The requestor also proposes  a  second  protection  suite  which  only
   consists of ESP using 3DES.

   This type of complexity was not initially  designed  in  the  existing
   RADIUS   protocol,  since  it  is  not  necessary  to  correlate  many
   attributes to form a single "proposal".  However,  document  [2]  does
   introduce this complexity with the use of the tag field. This document
   will  make  use  of  this  mechanism,  but  also  requires  additional
   information   within   the  RADIUS  attribute  to  include  preference
   information.

   The new header format as described in  section  5.0  is  necessary  in
   order  to  be able to "build" policies as defined above. Such a policy
   could be represented as follow:

      Tag = 1
          Protocol = AH / Preference = 1,
                Transform = SHA-1,
                Auth-Algorithm HMAC-SHA-1,
                SA-Life-Seconds = 28800,
                Encapsulation-Mode = Tunnel
          Protocol = AH / Preference = 2,
                Transform MD5,
                Auth-Algorithm HMAC-MD5,
                SA-Life-Kbs = 1024,
                Encapsulation-Mode = Tunnel
          Protocol = ESP / Preference = 1
                Transform DES,
                SA-Life-Seconds = 57600,
                Encapsulation-Mode = Tunnel

      Tag = 2
          Protocol = ESP / Preference = 1
                Transform = 3DES,
                Auth-Algorithm DES-MAC,
                SA-Life-Seconds = 57600,
                SA-Life-Kbs = 2048,
                Encapsulation-Mode = Tunnel

      Tag = 3
          Protocol = ESP / Preference = 1
                Transform = 3DES,
                Auth-Algorithm HMAC-SHA-1,
                SA-Life-Seconds = 57600,
                SA-Life-Kbs = 2048,
                Encapsulation-Mode = Transport

   The above defined policy states that Tag #1 has two AH transforms, the
   preferred  using SHA-1, the alternate using MD5. In addition ESP is to
   be used with DES as the transform. The second proposal is to only  use
   ESP  with  3DES  as  the  transform.  The  third proposal is added for
   completeness and depicts a simple policy using only ESP with  3DES  in
   transport mode.

   Note that since both the Protocol and the Preference fields  are  used
   to "classify" groups of attributes to form a single sub-proposal it is
   not possible to have  more  than  one  protocol  type  with  the  same
   preference number within a given tag.


4.0 Security Gateway Support


Vakil, Calhoun             expires May 1998                      [Page 7]



INTERNET DRAFT                                              November 1997


   The IPSEC Architecture specification[11]  defines  the  concept  of  a
   security  gateway,  which  is an intermediate node which provides some
   security functions. This means that although security from the NAS  to
   the  target host may be required, it also means that security from the
   NAS to the intermediate node is also required.

   This functionality further complicates this document since support for
   such devices must be included.

   Consider the following diagram which depicts such a configuration:

                                       +-----+
                                       |     |
                                    +--| RAD |
       +-----+            +-----+   |  |     |
       |     |    PSTN    |     |   |  +-----+
       | Bill|------------| NAS |---|
       |     |            |     |   |
       +-----+            +-----+   |  +-----+    +-----+
                                    |  |     |    |     |
                                    +--| S G |----|Targ.|
                                       |     |    |     |
                                  IP   +-----+    +-----+

   In this scenario the NAS is informed that it must first  establish  an
   ESP  tunnel to the Security Gateway (SG), and then use AH in transport
   mode to the target host shown above.

   Due to this requirement, it must now be possible to associate the peer
   with a given policy (as shown in section 3.0). Although it is possible
   to create a new header format to support the above case  it  would  be
   preferable to simply use the format defined in section 5.0.

   Using the header format defined in section 5.0 it is now  possible  to
   define a security hierarchy as shown below:

   Tag = 4
         Flag = First Host,
                SA-Destination = SG,
                Direction = Initiator,
                Remote-ID = foo,
                Policy = 1 / Preference = 1,
                Policy = 2 / Preference = 2,
                Next Hop = Target

   Tag = 5
         Flag = NULL
                SA-Destination = Target,
                SA-Direction = Initiator,
                Remote-ID = bar,

                Policy = 3 / Preference = 1

   The above example describes that a secure  link  must  be  established
   with  the Security Gateway using either Policy 1 or 2 (with preference
   given to #1). Once this is complete, a secure link must be established
   with  the  target  host using policy 3. Note that the Policy number is
   essentially the tag number  assigned  to  the  policies  described  in
   section 3.0

   Given the mechanism described  above  it  is  now  possible  to  build
   complex  hierarchies  of  security systems which must be penetrated in
   order to reach the target host.  Note  that  the  last  hop  will  not
   necessarily  be  the  target  host  since  a  Security  Gateway may be
   protecting the network instead.

   Since Phase 2 security association are unidirectional, it is neccesary
   to  specify  if  the  given  policy  is  for  the initiator or for the
   responder. In the example given above, the "policies" are what the NAS
   is to offer to the peer. When the SA-Direction is set to responder, it
   informs the NAS what policies it may accept from the peer.


5.0 Packet Format

   Packet Format is identical to that defined in RFC 2058 and 2059.


6.0 Packet Types

   Packet types are identical to those defined in RFC 2058 and 2059.

   See "Table of Attributes" below to determine which  types  of  packets
   can contain which attributes defined here.


7.0 Attributes

   This section will define the RADIUS Attributes which are used to  send
   Security  Policies or security hierarchies to the NAS for a given user
   connection.

   The new attribute format is shown below:

    Type

      The Type field is one octet.  Up-to-date values of the RADIUS  Type
      field are specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [12].
      Values 192-223 are reserved for experimental  use,  values  224-240
      are  reserved  for  implementation-specific use, and values 241-255
      are reserved and should not be used.  This  specification  concerns
      the following values:

          1-39   (refer to [1])
         40-51   (refer to [8] )
         52-59   Unused
         60-63   (refer to [1] )

    Length

      The Length field is one octet, and indicates  the  length  of  this
      attribute  including  the  Type,  Length  and  Value fields.  If an
      attribute is received in a  packet  with  an  invalid  Length,  the
      entire request should be silently discarded.

    Tag

      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide   a
      means  of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same policy or security hierarchy.

    Protocol

      A Protocol identifier. The following values are supported:
            1 - Authentication Header (AH)
            2 - Encapsulation Security Payload Header (ESP)

            3 - Internet Securit Association Key Management Protocol
                (ISAKMP)
            4 - IP Compression (IPCOMP)

      If the  protocol  identifier  in  the  attributes  is  ISAKMP,  the
      resulting  policy  is  meant  for  a  Phase  1 exchange.  A Phase 1
      exchange creates  ISAKMP  SAs  which  protect  further  negotiation
      traffic between the ISAKMP peers.

      If the protocol identifier in the  attribute  is  a  protocol  type
      other than ISAKMP, the resulting policy is meant for use in a Phase
      2 exchange.  A Phase 2 exchange happens under the protection  of  a
      pre-existing  Phase  1  SA,  and  negotiates  a SA for the protocol
      specified in the attribute.

    Flag

      The flag field contains information regarding the  content  of  the
      attribute. Note that each individual attribute description indicate
      whether the flag bit may be used.

      The following bits are defined:
             0x1 - (S bit) First Host in a chain

    Preference

      The specific preference for the stated protocol.

    Value

      The Value field is zero or more  octets  and  contains  information
      specific  to  the  attribute.   The  format and length of the Value
      field is determined by the Type and Length fields.

      The format of the value field is one of four data types.

      string    0-249 octets

      address   32 bit value, most significant octet first.

      integer   32 bit value, most significant octet first.

      time      32 bit value, most significant octet first -- seconds
                since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.  The standard
                Attributes do not use this data type.


7.1 Transform

   This attributes states the desired transform for the protocol.

   sent  in  the Access-Accept.  However, if the attribute is sent in the
   Access-Accept, the NAS has an option of ignoring it.  If the attribute
   is not present in the Access-Accept, the NAS MUST assume that it is to
   provide its own identity.

   If the protocol field is anything but ISAKMP, the  attribute  provides
   the  user  identity on the initiator side for a Phase 2 exchange (IDui

7.16 SA-Direction

   A Phase 2 SA is unidirectional.  This means that a  pair  of  SAs  are
   required to secure a session.  If the NAS is initiating the Phase 2 SA
   exchange, it needs a set of protection suites that it can  propose  to
   its peer.

   On the other hand, if the NAS is responding to a Phase 2 SA  exchange,
   it receives a set of protection suites from its peer. In this case, it
   needs a set of local protection suites to compare the proposed  suites
   against.   Hence it becomes necessary to provide the NAS with two sets
   of protection suites; one for use when it is the  initiator,  and  the
   other when it is the responder.
