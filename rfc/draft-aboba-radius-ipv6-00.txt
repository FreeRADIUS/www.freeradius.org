2.  Abstract

This document specifies the operation of RADIUS when run over IPv6 as
well as the RADIUS attributes used to support IPv6 network access.  Note
that the RADIUS server does not know a priori whether the NAS will be
using IPv4, IPv6, or both. Therefore it is presumed that the IPv6
attributes described in this document may be sent along with
IPv4-related attributes within the same RADIUS message and that the NAS
will decide which attributes to use.

attributes described in this document may be sent along with
IPv4-related attributes within the same RADIUS message and that the NAS
will decide which attributes to use.

The NAS can provide IPv6 access natively, or alternatively, via a tunnel
(6BONE). The choice of method for providing IPv6 access has no effect on
RADIUS usage per se, although if it is desired that an IPv6 within IPv4
tunnel be opened to a particular location, then tunnel attributes should
be utilized, as described in [7]-[8].

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT",  "optional",
"recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be interpreted as
described in [1].

4.  Attributes

4.1.  NAS-IPv6-Address

Description

   This Attribute indicates the identifying IPv6 Address of the NAS
   which is requesting authentication of the user, and SHOULD be unique
   to the NAS within the scope of the RADIUS server.  NAS-IPv6-Address
   is only used in Access-Request packets.  NAS-IPv6-Address and/or NAS-
   IP-Address MAY be present in an Access-Request packet; however, if
   neither attribute is present then NAS-Identifier MUST be present.

A summary of the NAS-IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.  The
fields are transmitted from left to right.

   user. It MAY be used in Access-Accept packets.  It MAY be used in an

   This Attribute indicates the system with which to connect the user,
   when the Login-Service Attribute is included. It MAY be used in
   Access-Accept packets. It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet as
   a hint to the server that the NAS would prefer to use that host, but

Address

   The Address field is 16 octets in length. The value
   0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF indicates that the NAS SHOULD
   allow the user to select an address.  The value 0 indicates that the
   NAS SHOULD select a host to connect the user to. Other values
   indicate the address the NAS SHOULD connect the user to.

4.5.  Framed-IPv6-Route

Description

   This Attribute provides routing information to be configured for the
   user on the NAS.  It is used in the Access-Accept packet and can
   appear multiple times.

A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Route Attribute format is shown below.  The
fields are transmitted from left to right.

Length

   >=3

Text

   The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
   implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable and
   MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended that
   the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [2] characters.

   For IPv6 routes, it SHOULD contain a destination prefix optionally
   followed by a slash and a decimal length specifier stating how many
   high order bits of the prefix to use. That is followed by a space, a
   gateway address, a space, and one or more metrics separated by
   spaces.

   Whenever the gateway address is specified as zero the IP address of
   the user SHOULD be used as the gateway address.

which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

7.  Security Considerations

This draft describes the use of RADIUS for the purposes of
authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled networks.
In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over IPv4 or over
IPv6. Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are
described in [6] and [3].

Since IPSEC [9] is mandatory to implement for IPv6, it is expected that
running RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 will typically run over
IPSEC. Where RADIUS is run over IPSEC and where certificates are used
for authentication, it may be desirable to avoid management of RADIUS
shared secrets, so as to leverage the improved scalability of public key
infrastructure.

Within RADIUS, a shared secret is used for hiding of attributes such as
User-Password [4] and Tunnel-Password [7]. In addition, the shared
secret is used in computation of the Response Authenticator [4], as well
as the Message-Authenticator attribute [6]. Therefore, in RADIUS a
shared secret is used to provide confidentiality as well as integrity
protection and authentication. As a result, only use of IPSEC ESP with a

non-null transform can provide security services sufficient to
substitute for RADIUS application-layer security. Therefore, where IPSEC
AH or ESP null is used, it will typically still be necessary to
configure a RADIUS shared secret.

However, where RADIUS is run over IPSEC ESP with a non-null transform,
the secret shared between the NAS and the RADIUS server MAY NOT be
configured. In this case, a shared secret of zero length MUST be
assumed.

8.  IANA Considerations

This draft requires the assignment of five new RADIUS attribute numbers
for the following attributes:

NAS-IPv6-Address
Framed-Interface-Id
Framed-IPv6-Prefix
Login-IPv6-Host
Framed-IPv6-Route
