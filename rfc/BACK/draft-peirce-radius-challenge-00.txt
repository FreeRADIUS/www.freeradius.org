Abstract

   Mobile IP Authentication is a requirement for the TR 45.6
   CDMA wireless packet data service architecture[8].
   Diameter AAA, as described in [1] and [2], is used to
   support Mobile IP authentication. This requires that both
   the foreign and home network deploy Diameter servers.
   Currently, RADIUS servers have been deployed and are
   widely used in the Internet Service Provider(ISP)
   arena.While DIAMETER is required to provide the advanced
   AAA support required by the TR 45.6 architecture, a smooth
   transition from RADIUS AAA to Diameter AAA is required. At
   a minimum,the Diameter AAA server located in a foreign
   network must inter-operate with RADIUS AAA located in Home
   Network.

   In this specification, a new SPI is specified to support
   Home RADIUS and Foreign DIAMETER AAA interaction. The
   specification requires extensions as specified in [6].

Applicability

This specification is intended for those DIAMETER servers
that wish to interoperate with current RADIUS servers using
PPP CHAP authentication.

1.0 Introduction

Diameter AAA, as described in [1] and [2] supports Mobile IP
authentication. This requires both foreign network and home
network to deploy Diameter servers. Currently, RADIUS servers
have been deployed and are used widely in the Internet. To
support a smooth transition from RADIUS AAA to Diameter AAA,
the minimum requirement is for the Diameter AAA server
located in foreign network to inter-operate with RADIUS AAA
located in Home Network.

In this specification, a new SPI is specified to support Home
RADIUS AAA in Mobile IP service. The specification requires
extensions as specified in [6]. A default algorithm is
described in [6] for computation of the authenticator field
from the MN-AAA Authentication Extension. The default
algorithm calculates the authenticator by using MD5 in
"prefix+suffix" mode.In this specification, a new SPI is
specified to support CHAP authentication. This algorithm
calculates the MN-AAA authenticator field by using MD5 in
"Prefix Only" mode.

2.0 Conventions

The following language conventions are used in the items  of
specification in this document:


        o  MUST, SHALL, or MANDATORY -- This item is an
        absolute requirement of the specification.

        be followed for all but exceptional circumstances.

        o  MAY or OPTIONAL -- This item is truly optional and
        may be followed or ignored according to the needs of
        the implementor.


3.0 Acronynms

mobile client(MC) - is a device that expects to be able to
maintain a network layer connection with its "home" network
despite have multiple short lived PPP connections with
different Foreign Agents.

Foreign Agent(FA) - is a device that issues advertisements,
via its PPP links with mobile nodes, that indicate its
willingness to act as an endpoint for a mobile IP tunnel.
Foreign Agents can change as the mobile node moves between
different regions.

Home Agent(HA) - is a device that maintains the connection
with the mobile node througout the mobile IP session.

Radio Network(RN) - The radio portion of the CDMA cellular
network.

4.0 Problem Space Overview

In this section we describe in high level terms the scope of
the problem being addressed.The two most likely scenarios to
encounter the problem are shown below.  Figure 1 depicts a
mobile client(MC) connecting through a radio network(RN) to a
Mobile IP foreign agent(FA). The FA uses a series of DIAMETER
servers to handle the authorization, acquisition of the
client profile (QoS level etc.) , of the MC. The final
DIAMETER stage of the DIAMETER server chain is called a
broker. It is called a broker because it handles MIP sessions
for multiple Home networks. For example, a major carrier
could offer connectivity for multiple ISPs.( The CDMA and
Broker networks could belong to the same entity.) The Broker
interacts with the Home network's RADIUS server to obtain the
required client records.

Figure 2 depicts a similar scenario with the Home agent
functionality also out-sourced by the broker network. Note
that in both cases the RADIUS server is maintained by the
Home network. This allows the Home network operator to
maintain control over Home network access and relieves the
Broker from having to maintain client records.

Figure 2

The problem is that the CHAP authentication mechanism defined
for MIP differs from that of RADIUS.Therefore, when the
broker DIAMETER server attempts to perform a CHAP proxy
authentication with the Home network RADIUS server, it will
fail.

5.0 Challenge/Response Authentication Calculation Parameter
Mis-match

In [6],the Challenge/Response mechanism has been used to
support Foreign Agent Authentication and Authorization.
RADIUS based CHAP protocol also uses the Challenge/Response
mechanism.

The RADIUS server calculates the authenticator using MD5 on
the following data:
  CHAP ID octet, KEY (or shared secret), CHAP challenge.

In [6], the Authenticator field from MC-AAA extension is
calculated by using MD5 in prefix + suffix mode over
following data:

Key || Preceding Mobile IP data || Type, Length, SPI || Key

This difference in the inputs to the hash function is what
causes the interoperability problem. In order to use CHAP and
inter-operate with RADIUS AAA, the MN-AAA extension is
defined as follows:

0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     Type      |     Length    |            SPI ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         ... SPI (cont.)        |       Authenticator...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             Figure 3: The MN-AAA Authentication Extension

      Type            36 (not skippable)

      Length          4 plus the number of bytes in the
                      Authenticator, MUST be at least 20.

      SPI             Security Parameters Index - TBD

      Authenticator   The variable length Authenticator field
                      consists of a random value of at
                      least 128 bits.

The algorithm for computation of the authenticator is MD5 [5]
computed on the following data, in the order shown:

 Challenge-Octet || Key || Preceding Mobile IP data || Type,
Length, SPI

The Type, Length, and SPI are as shown above.  The
Challenge-Octet is the last octet of the FA Challenge value
from the FA Challenge Extension.

Each mobile node MUST support the ability to produce the
authenticator by using MD5 as described above in order to
support Home RADIUS authentication. Again this is different
from the default algorithm as described in [6], which uses
MD5 in "prefix+suffix" mode.

6.0 Operation

In order to use a Home RADIUS server with a Diameter AAA
server for the first time Mobile IP registration
authentication as described in [1] and [2], the Mobile Node
and its corresponding Broker Diameter server will be
configured with the new SPI as described above. It is called
the "RADIUS Authentication SPI"

When a Mobile Node receives an Agent Advertisement message,
it MUST use the "RADIUS Authentication SPI" and the
corresponding algorithm to construct its Mobile Registration
Request message if RADIUS/DIAMETER CHAP authentication
interoperation is required..

The FA will then send an AA-Mobile-Node-Request(AMR) message
to the Diameter AAA located in its serving network.

The Serving Diameter AAA server will then use the NAI
extension to locate the Broker Diameter AAA server and
forward it the AMR message.

The Broker Diameter AAA server MUST then generate a RADIUS
Access-Request message based on the MN-AAA Authentication
extension and the NAI extension. This message MUST then be
sent to the Home RADIUS server.

The Access-Request message MUST be constructed as follows:

The CHAP-ID octet of the RADIUS CHAP-password attribute will
contain the last byte of the Challenge value from MIP FA
Challenge extension[6].  The authenticator from the MN-AAA
Authentication extension MUST be used as the CHAP-Password
attribute. The User-Name attribute MUST be populated with the
user-name attribute from the AMR message. The following data
stream, as described earlier, MUST be included in the CHAP-
Challenge attribute:

Preceding Mobile IP data || Type, Length, SPI.

The RADIUS server now looks up a password based on the User-
Name. It then encrypts the challenge using MD5 on:

 CHAP ID octet, locally stored password for this specific
User-Name, the CHAP challenge (from the CHAP-Challenge
attribute if present,otherwise from the Request
Authenticator),

The RADIUS server then compares this result with the CHAP-
Password(MN-AAA Authentication extension authenticator).  If
these values match, the server MUST send back a RADIUS
Access-Accept, otherwise it MUST send back a RADIUS Access-
Reject. See [7] for details.

Upon receipt of a  RADIUS Access-Accept message, the Broker
Diameter AAA server MUST generate a Home Agent MIP
Request(HAR)[1] and send it to the Home Agent. See [1] and
[2] for rest of the operation.

Upon receipt of a RADIUS Access-Reject message, the Broker
Diameter AAA server MUST generate an AA-Mobile-Node-
Answer(AMA)[1] with a  result and send it back to serving
Diameter AAA server as described in [1] and [2].
