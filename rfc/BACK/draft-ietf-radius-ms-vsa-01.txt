This document describes the set of Microsoft vendor-specific RADIUS
attributes.  These attributes are designed to support Microsoft
proprietary dial-up protocols and/or provide support for features
which is not provided by the standard RADIUS attribute set [3].  It is
expected that this memo will be updated whenever Microsoft defines a
new vendor-specific attribute, since its primary purpose is to
provide an open, easily accessible reference for third-parties wishing
to interoperate with Microsoft products.

This document is a product of the Remote Authentication Dial-In User
Service Working Group of the IETF.
