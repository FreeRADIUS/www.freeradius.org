Subject: Minutes of RADIUS BOF at 32nd IETF
Cc: minutes@cnri.reston.va.us, mo@uunet.uu.net, sob@harvard.edu

These are the minutes of the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
(RADIUS) BOF session held Tuesday 95/4/4 15:30-17:30 EST at the 32nd
IETF in Danvers MA, under the Operational Requirements Directorate.
There were 42 attendees; a list is attached below.

I would like to thank Larry Brandt (Brandt_Lawrence_R/svoa0001@ssb.com)
for forwarding to me his notes taken during the RADIUS BOF, which were
very helpful in producing these minutes.  Any omissions or errors should
be ascribed to myself.

Carl Rigney (cdr@livingston.com) chaired the BOF session, and started
by providing some historical background on RADIUS, noting that it has
now been in production use at many sites for 2+ years.

First question: Do we want a Working Group for RADIUS?  There was
strong consensus for yes.  Mr. Rigney agreed to provide a draft charter
and timeline to the ietf-radius@livingston.com mailing list by 4/17.

Second Question: Should RADIUS be put on a standards track?  There was
strong consensus for yes.

Clarification was requested on what "standards track" implied, and it
was explained as meaning "If you choose to support RADIUS here's how it
will work, but there's no requirement that you must support RADIUS in
your NAS (Network Access Server)."

There was a question regarding Cisco & Livingston's recent announcement
regarding TACACS+ and RADIUS, but no one present had any further
information regarding Cisco's plans in that regard.

There was a question as to whether the next revision of the RADIUS
Draft should include a table summarizing which kinds of attributes were
appropriate for which kinds of packet types.  There was extremely strong
consensus for yes.

Mr. Rigney described RADIUS Accounting briefly.  It uses UDP/IP to send
start and end of service records, but is acknowledged, buffered, and
includes an accounting session ID to make it easier to match up
records.  The end of service records includes an elapsed time attribute
to make it easier to determine usage.  Includes other attributes
detailing type of service, address used, NAS and Port used, etc.

There was a question on whether RADIUS Accounting should be included
with the rest of the RADIUS RFC or as a separate RFC, and if the latter
whether it should be standards track or experimental.  General
consensus was that RADIUS Accounting was much newer and more likely to
change with further experience than the rest of RADIUS, and therefore
should be issued as a separate, experimental RFC for now.

Most of the remainder was taken up in a discussion of the Proposed Charter,
with Mr. Rigney agreeing to provide a draft of the consensus by 4/17.

Elements generally considered desirable for the charter included:

   - documenting RADIUS implementation as it exists today, and not attempting
	to create "the perfect protocol."
   - The RADIUS protocol is the packet format and attributes used to
	communicate between the NAS and the server.  Specifics of the
	server implementation (e.g. data dictionary or otherwise)
	should not be specified.
   - RADIUS was designed to be very simple, and avoids the clutter of every
	possible attribute.  The burden on the NAS should be kept light.
   - Use of RADIUS to support 3rd party security (Kerberos, SafeWord,
	SecurId, etc.) - handling of challenge/response should be
	documented with perhaps some notes in an appendix on
	implementation factors to consider.
   - protocol is not intended to be all things for all uses, the RFC is
	intended to cover RADIUS as a protocol for Network Access Servers
	to speak with an Authentication & Authorization server
	Mike O'Dell nicely phrased it as a "service definition
	language for user access."
   - how user is authenticated is outside of the protocol; the protocol
	addresses how the NAS passes that information to the RADIUS server
	and how it gets back the results
   - CAT framework _could_ sit behind radius, but outside scope of our charter
   - interacts with DHCP but doesn't overlap
   - Definite strong consensus to include notes on how to handle PPP
     	CHAP with RADIUS
   - Add attributes for Appletalk over PPP and LAT for those vendors who 
	support those protocols, in addition to IP and IPX already present
   - RADIUS is not a NAS management protocol, and does not take place of SNMP
   - RADIUS is not a protocol for managing the user service database, but
	only for communicating between the NAS and such a database.
	Therefore radpass is still deprecated.
   - RADIUS server to server calls (Proxy) need not be addressed in
	the RFC, but the protocol should keep in mind that many people may
	intend to use it that way and should make it easy to do so. 
	In particular, server to server communications should look like
	NAS to server communications, to the server being called.
   - Charter is for standardized RADIUS not standardized NAS!
   - RADIUS for IPv6 appears straightforward, but is outside this charter
   - RADIUS over alternate transport protocols like IPX appears
	straightforward but is outside this charter

Consensus was for the Charter to be tightly focused on producing two
documents:
1) RADIUS as it exists and 
2) RADIUS Accounting,
and not get lured down new alleys to solve every problem under the sun.

For RADIUS Accounting, feedback is sought from developers of NAS user
accounting.

It was pointed out that new standards require a MIB, and suggested that
the RADIUS working group should approach the Net Management group re
developing a small MIB for the RADIUS server.  Clients do not require MIBs.

There was general and widespread interest in holding a RADIUS Bake-off
in the September or October '95 timeframe to get as many vendors as
possible in a room to test their independent implementations for
interoperability and vagueness in the spec.  Two attendees expressed
interest in possibly hosting such a bake-off and plans for such will be
followed up via the RADIUS mailing list, ietf-radius@livingston.com.

Discussion of timeline suggested putting a proposed standard out in the
next month or so, meet at the Dallas IETF in December 95 before
advancing to draft standard, and work towards June 96 for standard.
Accounting should be issued as an experimental RFC, offset
approximately one IETF from other document.  Mr. Rigney agreed to flesh
out proposed timeline and submit it to ietf-radius@livingston.com
mailing list (also attached below, but bear in mind it may change based
on reaction from working group).  General consensus was that the
timeline was aggressive but feasible, particuarly since implementations
already existed and were operating in the field, and much of the work
on the Internet-Draft has already been done.
