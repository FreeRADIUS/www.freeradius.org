Abstract
   This document describes the current practices for dynamically
   disconnecting and changing filters  applicable to a user session.
   The protocol uses RADIUS messages to send the disconnect request,
   but unlike RADIUS, the NAS in this case acts as a server and
   listens on a UDP port for requests originating from a client.

1.0 Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the
             specification.

   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that
             there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
             to ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST
             be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
             which does include the option.

1.1 Introduction

   The RADIUS protocol sends all the authorization information for a
   particular user in the Access-Accept packet and there are no
   further authorization exchanges between the NAS and the RADIUS
   server for the entire duration of the user session.
   To overcome this limitation, various vendors have implemented a
   reverse RADIUS protocol in which the NAS listens on a port for
   messages initiated from a client.  These messages currently belong
   to two groups:

   1) Disconnect messages, and
   2) Change of Filters messages

   The disconnect messages cause a user session to be terminated
   immediately, whereas change of filter messages modify the applicable
   packet filters for the user session.

   The packet format consists of the fields: Code, Identifier, Length,
   Authenticator and the Attributes in the Type, Length and Value (TLV)
   formats.  All the fields hold the same meaning as those described in
   RADIUS[1].  The Authenticator field is calculated as specified in [3]

1.2 Current Practices
   This draft outlines the details for Disconnect Requests and Change
   of Filters Requests that are commonly implemented.

1.2.1 Protocol Port Information
   For either type of request (Disconnect, or Change of Filters), the
   UDP port 1700 is used as the destination port.  For responses the
   source and destination ports are reversed.

1.2.2 Identification Attributes
   A number of attributes are used to uniquely identify a user session
   on the NAS and one, or more of these are present in either type of
   requests (Disconnect or, Change of Filters).  The set of attributes
   includes the following:

   Username(1): This is the name of the user associated with the session
   Acct-Session-Id(44): This is derived from a RADIUS Accounting-Start
   Framed-IP-Address(8): This is the IP Address associated with the
                         session

   Note:The numbers in parenthesis denote the attribute number in [1].
        The ability to use all/some of the identifiers to map to
        unique/multiple session(s) is beyond the scope of this document.

1.2.3 Disconnect-Request (DR)

   The packet of disconnect is used to dynamically end a user session
   on a NAS.  Current practices use the UPD port 1700 for sending
   requests.  For responses the ports are reversed.
   The request message contains one or more of the identification
   attributes.

Internet Draft          Dynamic Disconnect                 February 2002


    ----------     Disconnect-Request     ----------
   |          |  <--------------------   |          |
   |   NAS    |                          |  Client  |
   |          |   Disconnect-Response    |          |
   |          |   ---------------------> |          |
    ----------                            ----------

   Codes used:
   40 - Disconnect-Request
   41 - Disconnect-ACK
   42 - Disconnect-NAK

   A Disconnect Request is followed by a response of either,
   Disconnect-Ack if the NAS successfully disconnects the user, or a
   Disconnect-NAK if it was unable to disconnect the user.
   A Disconnect-Ack MAY contain the attribute Acct-Terminate-Cause(49)
   with the value set to 6 for Admin-Reset.

1.2.4 Change of Filters (CoF)

   The CoF request packets contain information for dynamically changing
   filters of a user's session.  The filters can be of either ingress,
   or egress kind and are in addition to the identification attributes.
   The port used and packet format are the same as that for disconnect.
   The following is the attribute sent in a request:

   Filter-ID(11) - Indicates the name of a filter list to be applied
                   for the session that maps to the identification
                   attributes.


     ----------      CoF Request           ----------
    |          |  <--------------------   |          |
    |   NAS    |                          |  Client  |
    |          |     CoF Response         |          |
    |          |   ---------------------> |          |
     ----------                            ----------

   Codes used:
   43 - CoF-Request
   44 - CoF-ACK
   45 - CoF-NAK

   A Change of Filter request is followed by a response of either,
   CoF-Ack if the NAS is able to successfully change the filters
   for the user's session and a CoF-NAK if it does not succeed.

1.3 Security Considerations
   To prevent modification of the packets, a 16 byte Authenticator
   is calculated employing the same algorithm as the one used for
   Accounting-Requests[3].
   To prevent replay attacks it is recommended that the Acct-Session-ID
   and Username combination be present in the disconnect requests.
   Further, it is also recommended to include the Event-Timestamp(55)[4]
   attribute to prevent replay attacks.
   The protocol, in addition,  is susceptible to the same
   vulnerabilities as RADIUS and it is recommended to use IPSec to
   afford better security.
