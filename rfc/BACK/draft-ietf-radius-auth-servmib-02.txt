     3.  Abstract

     This  memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS authen-
     tication server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the
     Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management pro-
     tocols in the Internet community.   Using  these  extensions  IP-based
     management stations can manage RADIUS authentication servers.


     4.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     authentication servers.

     RADIUS authentication servers are  today  widely  deployed  by  dialup
     Internet  Service  Providers,  in order to provide authentication ser-
     vices. As a result, the effective management of RADIUS  authentication
     servers is of considerable importance.


     5.  The SNMP Management Framework

     The  SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major compo-
     nents:

         o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

         o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects  and  events  for
             the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure
             of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and  described
             in  RFC  1155  [2],  RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second
             version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC  1903
             [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

         o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
             first version of the SNMP message protocol  is  called  SNMPv1
             and  described  in  RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
             message protocol, which is not  an  Internet  standards  track
             protocol,  is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
             RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the  message  protocol  is
             called  SNMPv3  and  described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11]
             and RFC 2274 [12].

         o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
             first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
             described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
             and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

         o   A  set  of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14]
             and the view-based access control mechanism described  in  RFC
             2275 [15].

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base  or  MIB.   Objects  in  the  MIB  are
     defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
     conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate trans-
     lations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent,
     except where objects or events are omitted because no  translation  is
     possible  (use  of  Counter64).  Some  machine readable information in
     SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during  the
     translation  process.  However, this loss of machine readable informa-
     tion is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

     6.  Overview

     The RADIUS authentication protocol, described in  [16],  distinguishes
     between the client function and the server function. In RADIUS authen-
     tication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers reply with Access-
     Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges.  Typically NAS devices
     implement the client function, and thus would be expected to implement
     the  RADIUS  authentication  client  MIB,  while RADIUS authentication
     servers implement the server function, and thus would be  expected  to
     implement the RADIUS authentication server MIB.

     However,  it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to perform
     both client and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may  act
     as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while simul-
     taneously acting as an authentication client to one or more  authenti-
     cation  servers.  In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS enti-
     ties combining client and server functionality will support  both  the
     client and server MIBs.


     6.1.  Selected objects

     This MIB module contains fourteen scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Authentication Client Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS authentication client that the server shares a secret with.

     Each  entry  in the RADIUS Authentication Client Table includes twelve
     columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS authentication
     server.

     9.  Security considerations

     There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have
     a  MAX-ACCESS  clause  of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
     may be considered sensitive or vulnerable  in  some  network  environ-
     ments.   The  support  for  SET operations in a non-secure environment
     without proper protection can have a negative effect on network opera-
     tions.

     There  are  a  number  of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
     sensitive information. These are:

     radiusAuthClientAddress
               This can be used to determine  the  address  of  the  RADIUS
               authentication  client  with which the server is communicat-
               ing. This information could be useful in  impersonating  the
               client.

     radiusAuthClientID
               This can be used to determine the client ID of the authenti-
               cation client with which the server is  communicating.  This
               information could be useful in impersonating the client.

     It  is  thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
     possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending  them
     over  the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
     for such a secure environment.

     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure  environment.  Even  if  the  network
     itself  is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
     to who on  the  secure  network  is  allowed  to  access  and  GET/SET
     (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

     It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
     as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,  the  use  of  the
     User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access Con-
     trol Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.  Using  these  security  fea-
     tures,   customer/users  can  give access to the objects only to those
     principals  (users)  that  have  legitimate  rights  to  GET  or   SET
     (change/create/delete) them.
