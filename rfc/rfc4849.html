Abstract

   While RFC 2865 defines the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Filter-Id">Filter-Id</A> attribute, it requires that the
   Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated with the desired
   filters.  However, in situations where the server operator does not
   know which filters have been pre-populated, it is useful to specify
   filter rules explicitly.  This document defines the <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A>
   attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
   (RADIUS).  This attribute is based on the Diameter <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A>
   Attribute Value Pair (AVP) described in RFC 4005, and the
   IPFilterRule syntax defined in RFC 3588.

<H2>1.  Introduction</H2>

   This document defines the <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attribute within the Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).  This attribute has the
   same functionality as the Diameter <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> AVP (400) defined
   in [RFC4005], Section 6.6, and the same syntax as an IPFilterRule
   defined in [RFC3588], Section 4.3.  This attribute may prove useful
   for provisioning of filter rules.

   While [RFC2865], Section 5.11, defines the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Filter-Id">Filter-Id</A> attribute (11),
   it requires that the Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated
   with the desired filters.  However, in situations where the server
   operator does not know which filters have been pre-populated, it is
   useful to specify filter rules explicitly.

<H2>1.1.  Terminology</H2>

   This document uses the following terms:

   Network Access Server (NAS)
      A device that provides an access service for a user to a network.

   RADIUS server
      A RADIUS authentication server is an entity that provides an
      authentication service to a NAS.

   RADIUS proxy
      A RADIUS proxy acts as an authentication server to the NAS, and a
      RADIUS client to the RADIUS server.

RFC 4849                 Filter Rule Attribute                April 2007


<H2>1.2.  Requirements Language</H2>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

<H2>1.3.  Attribute Interpretation</H2>

   If a NAS conforming to this specification receives an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A>
   packet containing a <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attribute that it cannot apply,
   it MUST act as though it had received an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Reject">Access-Reject</A>.  [RFC3576]
   requires that a NAS receiving a Change of Authorization Request
   (CoA-Request) reply with a CoA-NAK if the Request contains an
   unsupported attribute.  It is RECOMMENDED that an <A HREF="rfc3576.html#Error-Cause">Error-Cause</A>
   attribute with value set to "Unsupported Attribute" (401) be included
   in the CoA-NAK.  As noted in [RFC3576], authorization changes are
   atomic so that this situation does not result in session termination,
   and the pre-existing configuration remains unchanged.  As a result,
   no accounting packets should be generated because of the CoA-Request.

<A NAME="NAS-Filter-Rule"><H2>2.  NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

   This attribute indicates filter rules to be applied for this user.
   Zero or more <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes MAY be sent in <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A>,
   CoA-Request, or <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request">Accounting-Request</A> packets.

   The <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attribute is not intended to be used concurrently
   with any other filter rule attribute, including <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Filter-Id">Filter-Id</A> (11) and
   NAS-Traffic-Rule [Traffic] attributes.  <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> and NAS-
   Traffic-Rule attributes MUST NOT appear in the same RADIUS packet.
   If a NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute is present, a NAS implementing this
   specification MUST silently discard any <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes
   that are present.  <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Filter-Id">Filter-Id</A> and <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes SHOULD
   NOT appear in the same RADIUS packet.  Given the absence in [RFC4005]
   of well-defined precedence rules for combining <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Filter-Id">Filter-Id</A> and NAS-
   Filter-Rule attributes into a single rule set, the behavior of NASes
   receiving both attributes is undefined, and therefore a RADIUS server
   implementation cannot assume a consistent behavior.

   Where multiple <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes are included in a RADIUS
   packet, the String field of the attributes are to be concatenated to
   form a set of filter rules.  As noted in [RFC2865], Section 2.3, "the
   forwarding server MUST NOT change the order of any attributes of the
   same type", so that RADIUS proxies will not reorder <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B>
   attributes.

   A summary of the <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> Attribute format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

<B>   Type</B>

      92

<B>   Length</B>

      &gt;=3

   String

      The String field is one or more octets.  It contains filter rules
      in the IPFilterRule syntax defined in [RFC3588], Section 4.3, with
      individual filter rules separated by a NUL (0x00).  A NAS-Filter-
      Rule attribute may contain a partial rule, one rule, or more than
      one rule.  Filter rules may be continued across attribute
      boundaries, so implementations cannot assume that individual
      filter rules begin or end on attribute boundaries.

      The set of <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes SHOULD be created by
      concatenating the individual filter rules, separated by a NUL
      (0x00) octet.  The resulting data should be split on 253-octet
      boundaries to obtain a set of <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes.  On
      reception, the individual filter rules are determined by
      concatenating the contents of all <B>NAS-Filter-Rule</B> attributes, and
      then splitting individual filter rules with the NUL octet (0x00)
      as a delimiter.

<H2>3.  Table of Attributes</H2>

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access- Access-   CoA-  Acct-
   Request Accept  Reject  Challenge Req   Req   #   Attribute
    0       0+      0       0        0+    0+    92  <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A>

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

     0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in the packet.
     0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.
     0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.

<H2>4.  Diameter Considerations</H2>

   [RFC4005], Section 6.6, defines the <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> AVP (400) with
   the same functionality as the RADIUS <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attribute.  In
   order to support interoperability, Diameter/RADIUS gateways will need
   to be configured to translate RADIUS attribute 92 to Diameter NAS-
   Filter-Rule AVP (400) and vice versa.

   When translating Diameter <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> AVPs to RADIUS NAS-Filter-
   Rule attributes, the set of <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attributes is created by
   concatenating the individual filter rules, separated by a NUL octet.
   The resulting data SHOULD then be split on 253-octet boundaries.

   When translating RADIUS <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attributes to Diameter NAS-
   Filter-Rule AVPs, the individual rules are determined by
   concatenating the contents of all <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attributes, and
   then splitting individual filter rules with the NUL octet as a
   delimiter.  Each rule is then encoded as a single Diameter NAS-
   Filter-Rule AVP.

   Note that a translated Diameter message can be larger than the
   maximum RADIUS packet size (4096 bytes).  Where a Diameter/RADIUS
   gateway receives a Diameter message containing a <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> AVP
   that is too large to fit into a RADIUS packet, the Diameter/RADIUS
   gateway will respond to the originating Diameter peer with a Result-
   Code AVP with the value DIAMETER_RADIUS_AVP_UNTRANSLATABLE (5018),
   and with a Failed-AVP AVP containing the <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> AVP.  Since
   repairing the error will probably require re-working the filter
   rules, the originating peer should treat the combination of a
   Result-Code AVP with value DIAMETER_RADIUS_AVP_UNTRANSLATABLE and a
   Failed-AVP AVP containing a <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> AVP as a terminal error.

<H2>5.  IANA Considerations</H2>

   This specification does not create any new registries.

   This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see
   &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types&gt;.  One value has been
   allocated in the section "RADIUS Attribute Types".  The RADIUS
   attribute for which a value has been assigned is:

      92 - <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A>

   This document also utilizes the Diameter [RFC3588] namespace.  A
   Diameter Result-Code AVP value for the
   DIAMETER_RADIUS_AVP_UNTRANSLATABLE error has been allocated.  Since
   this is a permanent failure, the allocation (5018) is in the 5xxx
   range.

<H2>6.  Security Considerations</H2>

   This specification describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting.  Threats and security
   issues for this application are described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3580];
   security issues encountered in roaming are described in [RFC2607].

   This document specifies a new attribute that can be included in
   existing RADIUS packets, which are protected as described in
   [RFC3579] and [RFC3576].  See those documents for a more detailed
   description.

   The security mechanisms supported in RADIUS and Diameter are focused
   on preventing an attacker from spoofing packets or modifying packets
   in transit.  They do not prevent an authorized RADIUS/Diameter server
   or proxy from modifying, inserting, or removing attributes with
   malicious intent.  Filter attributes modified or removed by a
   RADIUS/Diameter proxy may enable a user to obtain network access
   without the appropriate filters; if the proxy were also to modify
   accounting packets, then the modification would not be reflected in
   the accounting server logs.

   Since the RADIUS protocol currently does not support capability
   negotiation, a RADIUS server cannot automatically discover whether a
   NAS supports the <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attribute.  A legacy NAS not
   compliant with this specification may silently discard the NAS-
   Filter-Rule attribute while permitting the user to access the
   network.  This can cause users to improperly receive unfiltered
   access to the network.  As a result, the <A HREF="#NAS-Filter-Rule">NAS-Filter-Rule</A> attribute
   SHOULD only be sent to a NAS that is known to support it.
