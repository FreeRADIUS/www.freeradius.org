Abstract 
   This document describes the current practices for dynamically 
   disconnecting a user session on the NAS.
   The protocol uses RADIUS messages to send the disconnect request,
   but unlike RADIUS, the NAS in this case acts as a server and 
   listens on a UDP port for requests originating from a client.


1.0 Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the
             specification.

   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that
             there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
             to ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST
             be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
             which does include the option.

1.1 Introduction

   The RADIUS protocol sends all the authorization information for a 
   particular user in the Access-Accept packet and there are no 
   further authorization exchanges between the NAS and the RADIUS 
   server for the entire duration of the user session.
   To overcome this limitation, various vendors have implemented a 
   reverse RADIUS protocol in which the NAS listens on a port for 
   messages initiated from a client.  These messages currently belong  
   to two groups:

   1) Disconnect messages, and
   2) Change of Filters messages

   The disconnect messages cause a user session to be terminated 
   immediately, whereas change of filter messages modify the applicable
   packet filters for the user session and is the subject of this draft.

   The packet format consists of the fields: Code, Identifier, Length, 
   Authenticator and the Attributes in the Type, Length and Value (TLV)
   formats.  All the fields hold the same meaning as those described in 
   RADIUS[1].

Internet Draft          Dynamic Disconnect                 November 2001

1.2 Current Practices
   This draft outlines the details for Disconnect Requests only and 
   will not attempt to detail Change of Filters which is considered 
   as beyond the scope of this draft.

1.2.1 Disconnect-Request (DR)
   
   As mentioned earlier, the packet of disconnect is used to dynamically
   end a user session on a NAS.  Current practices use the UPD port
   1700 for sending requests.  For responses the ports are reversed.
   The response packets do not contain any attributes, but the request 
   message contains either, or all of the following identification 
   attributes:
 
   Username(1): This the name of the user associated with the session
   Acct-Session-Id(44): This is derived from a RADIUS accounting Start 
   Framed-IP-Address(8): This is the IP Address associated with the 
                         session

   Note:The numbers in parenthesis denote the attribute number in RADIUS.
        The ability to use all/some of the identifiers to map to 
        unique/multiple session(s) is beyond the scope of this document.


    ----------     Disconnect-Request     ----------
   |          |  <--------------------   |          |
   |   NAS    |                          |  Client  |
   |          |   Disconnect-Response    |          | 
   |          |   ---------------------> |          | 
    ----------                            ----------

   Codes used:
   40 - Disconnect-Request
   41 - Disconnect-ACK
   42 - Disconnect-NAK

   A Disconnect Request is followed by a response of either, 
   Disconnect-Ack if the NAS successfully disconnects the user, or a
   Disconnect-NAK if it was unable to disconnect the user.

1.3 Security Considerations
   To prevent modification of the packets, a 16 byte Authenticator 
   is calculated employing the same algorithm as the one used for 
   Accounting-Requests[3].
   To prevent replay attacks it is recommended that the Acct-Session-ID
   and Username combination be present in the disconnect requests.
   Further, it is also recommended to include the Event-Timestamp(55)[4]
   attribute to prevent replay attacks.
   The protocol, in addition,  is susceptible to the same 
   vulnerabilities as RADIUS and it is recommended to use IPSec to 
   afford better security.
