     3.  Abstract

     This  memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS authen-
     tication client functions. These extensions represent a portion of the
     Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management pro-
     tocols in the Internet community.   Using  these  extensions  IP-based
     management stations can manage RADIUS authentication clients.


     4.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     authentication clients.

     Today a wide range of network devices, including  routers  and  NASes,
     act  as  RADIUS authentication clients in order to provide authentica-
     tion and authorization services. As a result, the effective management
     of RADIUS authentication clients is of considerable importance.


     5.  The SNMP Management Framework

     The  SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major compo-
     nents:

         o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

         o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects  and  events  for
             the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure
             of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and  described
             in  RFC  1155  [2],  RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second
             version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC  1903
             [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

         o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
             first version of the SNMP message protocol  is  called  SNMPv1
             and  described  in  RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
             message protocol, which is not  an  Internet  standards  track
             protocol,  is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
             RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the  message  protocol  is
             called  SNMPv3  and  described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11]
             and RFC 2274 [12].

         o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
             first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
             described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
             and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

         o   A  set  of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14]
             and the view-based access control mechanism described  in  RFC
             2275 [15].

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base  or  MIB.   Objects  in  the  MIB  are
     defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
     conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate trans-
     lations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent,
     except where objects or events are omitted because no  translation  is
     possible  (use  of  Counter64).  Some  machine readable information in
     SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during  the
     translation  process.  However, this loss of machine readable informa-
     tion is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

     6.  Overview

     The RADIUS authentication protocol, described in  [16],  distinguishes
     between the client function and the server function. In RADIUS authen-
     tication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers reply with Access-
     Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges.  Typically NAS devices
     implement the client function, and thus would be expected to implement
     the  RADIUS  authentication  client  MIB,  while RADIUS authentication
     servers implement the server function, and thus would be  expected  to
     implement the RADIUS authentication server MIB.

     However,  it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to perform
     both client and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may  act
     as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while simul-
     taneously acting as an authentication client to one or more  authenti-
     cation  servers.  In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS enti-
     ties combining client and server functionality will support  both  the
     client and server MIBs.


     6.1.  Selected objects
     This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Authentication Server Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS authentication server that the client shares a secret with.

     Each  entry in the RADIUS Authentication Server Table includes fifteen
     columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS authentication
     client.

     9.  Security considerations

     There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have  a  MAX-
     ACCESS  clause  of  read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
     implemented correctly, then there is no  risk  that  an  intruder  can
     alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP SET
     operations.

     There are a number of managed objects in this  MIB  that  may  contain
     sensitive information. These are:

     radiusAuthServerAddress
               This  can  be  used  to  determine the address of the RADIUS
               authentication server with which the client  is  communicat-
               ing.  This information could be useful in mounting an attack
               on the authentication server.

     radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber
               This can be used to determine the port number on  which  the
               RADIUS  authentication  client  is sending. This information
               could be useful in impersonating the client in order to send
               data to the authentication server.

     It  is  thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
     possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending  them
     over  the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
     for such a secure environment.

     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure  environment.  Even  if  the  network
     itself  is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
     to who on  the  secure  network  is  allowed  to  access  and  GET/SET
     (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

     It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
     as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,  the  use  of  the
     User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access Con-
     trol Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.  Using  these  security  fea-
     tures,   customer/users  can  give access to the objects only to those
     principals  (users)  that  have  legitimate  rights  to  GET  or   SET
     (change/create/delete) them.
