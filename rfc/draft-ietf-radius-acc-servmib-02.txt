     2.  Abstract

     This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS account-
     ing server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Man-
     agement  Information Base (MIB) for use with network management proto-
     cols in the Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based  man-
     agement stations can manage RADIUS accounting servers.


     3.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     accounting servers.

     RADIUS accounting servers are today widely deployed by dialup Internet
     Service  Providers,  in  order  to  provide  accounting services. As a
     result, the effective management of RADIUS accounting  servers  is  of
     considerable importance.

     4.  The SNMP Management Framework

     The  SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major compo-
     nents:

         o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

         o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects  and  events  for
             the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure
             of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and  described
             in  RFC  1155  [2],  RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second
             version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC  1903
             [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

         o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
             first version of the SNMP message protocol  is  called  SNMPv1
             and  described  in  RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
             message protocol, which is not  an  Internet  standards  track
             protocol,  is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
             RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the  message  protocol  is
             called  SNMPv3  and  described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11]
             and RFC 2274 [12].

         o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
             first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
             described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
             and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

         o   A  set  of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14]
             and the view-based access control mechanism described  in  RFC
             2275 [15].

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base  or  MIB.   Objects  in  the  MIB  are
     defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
     conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate trans-
     lations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent,
     except where objects or events are omitted because no  translation  is
     possible  (use  of  Counter64).  Some  machine readable information in
     SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during  the
     translation  process.  However, this loss of machine readable informa-
     tion is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


     5.  Overview

     The RADIUS  accounting  protocol,  described  in  [16],  distinguishes
     between  the  client  function  and  the  server  function.  In RADIUS
     accounting, clients send Accounting-Requests, and servers  reply  with
     Accounting-Responses.   Typically  NAS  devices  implement  the client
     function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS  account-
     ing  client  MIB, while RADIUS accounting servers implement the server



     Zorn & Aboba                 Informational                    [Page 2]

     function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS  account-
     ing server MIB.

     However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to perform both
     client and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as  a
     server  to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while simultaneously
     acting as an accounting client to one or more accounting servers.   In
     such  situations, it is expected that RADIUS entities combining client
     and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.


     5.1.  Selected objects

     This MIB module contains thirteen scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Accounting Client Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS accounting client that the server shares a secret with.

     Each  entry  in  the  RADIUS  Accounting  Client Table includes eleven
     columns presenting a view of the activity  of  the  RADIUS  accounting
     server.

     8.  Security considerations

     There are management  objects  (radiusAccServConfigReset)  defined  in
     this  MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-cre-
     ate.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable  in  some
     network  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
     environment without proper protection can have a  negative  effect  on
     network operations.

     There  are  a  number  of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
     sensitive information. These are:

     radiusAccClientAddress
               This can be used to determine  the  address  of  the  RADIUS
               accounting  client  with  which the server is communicating.
               This  information  could  be  useful  in  impersonating  the
               client.

     radiusAccClientID
               This can be used to determine the client ID for the account-
               ing client with which  the  server  is  communicating.  This
               information could be useful in impersonating the client.

     It  is  thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
     possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending  them
     over  the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
     for such a secure environment.

     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure  environment.  Even  if  the  network
     itself  is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
     to who on  the  secure  network  is  allowed  to  access  and  GET/SET
     (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

     It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
     as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,  the  use  of  the
     User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access Con-
     trol Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.  Using  these  security  fea-
     tures,   customer/users  can  give access to the objects only to those
     principals  (users)  that  have  legitimate  rights  to  GET  or   SET
     (change/create/delete) them.
