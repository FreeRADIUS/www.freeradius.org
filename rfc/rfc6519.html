                 RADIUS Extensions for Dual-Stack Lite

Abstract

   Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6
   prefix.  Dual-Stack Lite requires pre-configuration of the Dual-Stack
   Lite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) tunnel information on
   the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.  In many networks, the
   customer profile information may be stored in Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, while client
   configurations are mainly provided through the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  This document specifies a new Remote
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the
   Dual-Stack Lite AFTR tunnel name; the RADIUS attribute is defined
   based on the equivalent DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option.  This RADIUS
   attribute is meant to be used between the RADIUS server and the
   Network Access Server (NAS); it is not intended to be used directly
   between the B4 element and the RADIUS server.

RFC 6519                DS-Lite RADIUS Extensions          February 2012


<H2>1.  Introduction</H2>

   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix
   (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment device).  One of its
   key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, but a Dual-Stack-Lite
   Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element will not know if the network to
   which it is attached offers Dual-Stack Lite support.  Even if the B4
   did know, it would not know the remote end of the tunnel to which it
   could establish a connection.

   To inform the B4 element of the location of the Address Family
   Transition Router (AFTR), a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) may be
   used.  Once this information is conveyed, the presence of the
   configuration indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host to
   initiate Dual-Stack Lite (<A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A>) service and become a Softwire
   Initiator.

   [RFC6334] specifies a DHCPv6 option that is meant to be used by a
   <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> client (B4 element) to discover its AFTR name.  In order to
   be able to populate such an option, the DHCPv6 server must be
   pre-provisioned with the AFTR name.

   In broadband environments, a customer profile may be managed by
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, together
   with AAA for users.  The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
   (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] is usually used by AAA servers to
   communicate with network elements.  [RADIUS-IPv6] describes a typical
   broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS)
   acts as the access gateway for the users (hosts or Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE) devices) and also embeds a DHCPv6 server function
   that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6 requests issued by the
   clients.

   Since the <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> AFTR information can be stored in AAA servers and
   the client configuration is mainly provided through DHCP running
   between the NAS and the requesting clients, a new RADIUS attribute is
   needed to send AFTR information from the AAA server to the NAS.

   This document defines a new RADIUS attribute to be used for carrying
   the <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> Tunnel Name, based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option
   already specified in [RFC6334].

<H2>2.  Terminology</H2>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) and the
   <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR) are defined
   in [RFC6333].

<H2>3.  DS-Lite Configuration with RADIUS and DHCPv6</H2>

   Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work together
   to accomplish <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> configuration on the B4 element when a PPP
   session is used to provide connectivity to the user.

   The NAS operates as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP Server.  The NAS
   initially sends a RADIUS <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> message to the RADIUS server,
   requesting authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the
   request, it validates the sending client, and if the request is
   approved, the AAA server replies with an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> message
   including a list of attribute-value pairs that describe the
   parameters to be used for this session.  This list MAY also contain
   the AFTR tunnel name.  When the NAS receives a DHCPv6 client request
   containing the <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> tunnel option, the NAS SHALL use the name
   returned in the RADIUS <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A> attribute to populate the
   DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option in the DHCPv6 reply message.

        Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for a PPP Session

   Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work together
   to accomplish <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> configuration on the B4 element when an IP
   session is used to provide connectivity to the user.

   The only difference between this message flow and the previous one is
   that in this scenario, the interaction between the NAS and the AAA/
   RADIUS server is triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by
   the NAS from the B4 acting as a DHCPv6 client, while in the case of a
   PPP session, the trigger is the PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP)
   Config-Request message received by the NAS.

        Figure 2: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for an IP Session

   In the scenario depicted in Figure 2, the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet
   contains a <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Service-Type">Service-Type</A> attribute with the value Authorize Only (17);
   thus, according to [RFC5080], the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet MUST contain
   a <A HREF="rfc2865.html#State">State</A> attribute.

   After receiving the <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A> attribute in the initial
   <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packet, the NAS MUST store the received AFTR tunnel
   name locally.  When the B4 sends a DHCPv6 Renew message to request an
   extension of the lifetimes for the assigned address or prefix, the
   NAS does not have to initiate a new <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet towards the
   AAA server to request the AFTR tunnel name.  The NAS retrieves the
   previously stored AFTR tunnel name and uses it in its reply.

   According to [RFC3315], if the DHCPv6 server to which the DHCPv6
   Renew message was sent at time T1 has not responded, the DHCPv6
   client initiates a Rebind/Reply message exchange with any available
   server.  In this scenario, the NAS receiving the DHCPv6 Rebind
   message MUST initiate a new <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> message towards the AAA
   server.  The NAS MAY include the <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A> attribute in its
   <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> message.

   If the NAS does not receive the <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A> attribute in the
   <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured default
   tunnel name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured

   default tunnel name or if the NAS receives an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Reject">Access-Reject</A> message,
   the IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel cannot be established; thus, the B4 element
   has only IPv6 connectivity.

<H2>4.  RADIUS Attribute</H2>

   This section specifies the format of the new RADIUS attribute.

<A NAME="DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name"><H2>4.1.  DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</H2></a>

   The <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> RADIUS attribute contains an FQDN that refers
   to the AFTR to which the client is requested to establish a
   connection.  The NAS SHALL use the name returned in the RADIUS
   <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> attribute to populate the DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME
   option [RFC6334].

   This attribute MAY be used in <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packets as a hint to the
   RADIUS server; for example, if the NAS is pre-configured with a
   default tunnel name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute.  The
   RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS, and it MAY assign
   a different AFTR tunnel name.

   If the NAS includes the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> attribute, but the AAA
   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the
   AAA server.

   If the NAS does not receive the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> attribute in the
   <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured default
   tunnel name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured
   default tunnel name, the tunnel cannot be established.

   If the NAS is pre-provisioned with a default AFTR tunnel name and the
   AFTR tunnel name received in the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> message is different
   from the configured default, then the AFTR tunnel name received in
   the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> message MUST be used for the session.

   If the NAS cannot support the received AFTR tunnel name for any
   reason, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be established.

   When the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> message is triggered by a DHCPv6 Rebind
   message, if the AFTR tunnel name received in the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A>
   message is different from the currently used one for that session,
   the NAS MUST force the B4 to re-establish the tunnel using the new
   AFTR name received in the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> message.

   If an implementation includes <A HREF="rfc5176.html#Change-of-Authorization">Change-of-Authorization</A> (CoA) messages
   [RFC5176], they could be used to modify the current established
   <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> tunnel.  When the NAS receives a CoA Request message

   containing the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> attribute, the NAS MUST send a
   Reconfigure message to a B4 to inform the B4 that the NAS has new or
   updated configuration parameters and that the B4 is to initiate a
   Renew/Reply or Information-Request/Reply transaction with the NAS in
   order to receive the updated information.

   Upon receiving an AFTR tunnel name different from the currently used
   one, the B4 MUST terminate the current <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> tunnel, and the B4
   MUST establish a new <A HREF="#DS-Lite">DS-Lite</A> tunnel with the specified AFTR.

   The <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> RADIUS attribute MAY be present in
   <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request">Accounting-Request</A> records where the <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Acct-Status-Type">Acct-Status-Type</A> is set to
   Start, Stop, or Interim-Update.  The <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> RADIUS
   attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a message.

   A summary of the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> RADIUS attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   As the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> attribute is used to populate the DHCPv6
   OPTION_AFTR_NAME option, the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> field is formatted
   as required in DHCPv6 (Section 8 of [RFC3315] -- "Representation and
   Use of Domain Names").  Briefly, the format described is using a
   single octet noting the length of one DNS label (limited to at most
   63 octets), followed by the label contents.  This repeats until all
   labels in the FQDN are exhausted, including a terminating zero-length
   label.  Any updates to Section 8 of [RFC3315] also apply to the
   encoding of this field.

RFC 6519                DS-Lite RADIUS Extensions          February 2012


   The data type of the <B>DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</B> RADIUS attribute is a string
   with opaque encapsulation, according to Section 5 of [RFC2865].

<H2>5.  Table of Attributes</H2>

   The following tables provide a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access-  Challenge Accounting #   Attribute
   Request Accept  Reject             Request
   0-1     0-1     0        0         0-1        144 <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A>

   CoA-Request CoA-ACK CoA-NACK #   Attribute
   0-1         0       0        144 <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A>

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

   0   This attribute MUST NOT be present in the packet.
   0+  Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in the
       packet.
   0-1 Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in the
       packet.

<H2>6.  Security Considerations</H2>

   This document has no additional security considerations beyond those
   already identified in [RFC2865] for the RADIUS protocol and in
   [RFC5176] for CoA messages.

   [RFC6333] discusses security issues related to Dual-Stack Lite.

<H2>7.  IANA Considerations</H2>

   Per this document, IANA has allocated a new RADIUS attribute type
   from the IANA registry "Radius Attribute Types" located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types.

      <A HREF="#DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name">DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name</A> - 144
