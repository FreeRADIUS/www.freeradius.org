Abstract

   This document defines a set of RADIUS attributes designed to support
   the provision of compulsory tunneling in dial-up networks.

<H2>1.  Motivation</H2>

   Many applications of tunneling protocols such as L2TP involve dial-up
   network access.  Some, such as the provision of access to corporate
   intranets via the Internet, are characterized by voluntary tunneling:
   the tunnel is created at the request of the user for a specific
   purpose.  Other applications involve compulsory tunneling: the tunnel
   is created without any action from the user and without allowing the
   user any choice in the matter.  In order to provide this
   functionality, new RADIUS attributes are needed to carry the
   tunneling information from the RADIUS server to the tunnel end
   points; this document defines those attributes.  Specific
   recommendations for, and examples of, the application of these
   attributes for L2TP can be found in RFC 2809.

RFC 2868        RADIUS Tunnel Authentication Attributes        June 2000


<H2>2.  Specification of Requirements</H2>

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [14].

<H2>3.  Attributes</H2>

   Multiple instances of each of the attributes defined below may be
   included in a single RADIUS packet.  In this case, the attributes to
   be applied to any given tunnel SHOULD all contain the same value in
   their respective Tag fields; otherwise, the Tag field SHOULD NOT be
   used.

   If the RADIUS server returns attributes describing multiple tunnels
   then the tunnels SHOULD be interpreted by the tunnel initiator as
   alternatives and the server SHOULD include an instance of the
   <A HREF="#Tunnel-Preference">Tunnel-Preference</A> Attribute in the set of Attributes pertaining to
   each alternative tunnel.  Similarly, if the RADIUS client includes
   multiple sets of tunnel Attributes in an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet, all
   the Attributes pertaining to a given tunnel SHOULD contain the same
   value in their respective Tag fields and each set SHOULD include an
   appropriately valued instance of the <A HREF="#Tunnel-Preference">Tunnel-Preference</A> Attribute.

<A NAME="Tunnel-Type"><H2>3.1.  Tunnel-Type</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

      This Attribute indicates the tunneling protocol(s) to be used (in
      the case of a tunnel initiator) or the the tunneling protocol in
      use (in the case of a tunnel terminator).  It MAY be included in
      <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A>, <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> and <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request">Accounting-Request</A> packets.  If
      the <B>Tunnel-Type</B> Attribute is present in an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet
      sent from a tunnel initiator, it SHOULD be taken as a hint to the
      RADIUS server as to the tunnelling protocols supported by the
      tunnel end-point; the RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint, however.
      A tunnel initiator is not required to implement any of these
      tunnel types; if a tunnel initiator receives an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A>
      packet which contains only unknown or unsupported <B>Tunnel-Type</B>s,
      the tunnel initiator MUST behave as though an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Reject">Access-Reject</A> had
      been received instead.

      If the <B>Tunnel-Type</B> Attribute is present in an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A>
      packet sent from a tunnel terminator, it SHOULD be taken to
      signify the tunnelling protocol in use.  In this case, if the
      RADIUS server determines that the use of the communicated protocol
      is not authorized, it MAY return an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Reject">Access-Reject</A> packet.  If a
      tunnel terminator receives an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packet which contains

      one or more <B>Tunnel-Type</B> Attributes, none of which represent the
      tunneling protocol in use, the tunnel terminator SHOULD behave as
      though an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Reject">Access-Reject</A> had been received instead.

   A summary of the <B>Tunnel-Type</B> Attribute format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

<A NAME="Tunnel-Medium-Type"><H2>3.2.  Tunnel-Medium-Type</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

      The <B>Tunnel-Medium-Type</B> Attribute indicates which transport medium
      to use when creating a tunnel for those protocols (such as L2TP)
      that can operate over multiple transports.  It MAY be included in
      both <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> and <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packets; if it is present in
      an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet, it SHOULD be taken as a hint to the
      RADIUS server as to the tunnel media supported by the tunnel end-
      point.  The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint, however.

   A summary of the <B>Tunnel-Medium-Type</B> Attribute format is given below.
   The fields are transmitted left to right.

   Tag
      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a
      means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same tunnel.  Valid values for this field are 0x01 through 0x1F,
      inclusive.  If the Tag field is unused, it MUST be zero (0x00).

<B>   Value</B>
      The Value field is three octets and contains one of the values
      listed under "Address Family Numbers" in [14].  For the sake of
      convenience, a relevant excerpt of this list is reproduced below.

<A NAME="Tunnel-Client-Endpoint"><H2>3.3.  Tunnel-Client-Endpoint</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

      This Attribute contains the address of the initiator end of the
      tunnel.  It MAY be included in both <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> and Access-
      Accept packets to indicate the address from which a new tunnel is
      to be initiated.  If the <B>Tunnel-Client-Endpoint</B> Attribute is
      included in an <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet, the RADIUS server should
      take the value as a hint; the server is not obligated to honor the
      hint, however.  This Attribute SHOULD be included in Accounting-
      Request packets which contain <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Acct-Status-Type">Acct-Status-Type</A> attributes with
      values of either Start or Stop, in which case it indicates the
      address from which the tunnel was initiated.  This Attribute,
      along with the <A HREF="#Tunnel-Server-Endpoint">Tunnel-Server-Endpoint</A> and Acct-Tunnel-Connection-
      ID attributes, may be used to provide a globally unique means to
      identify a tunnel for accounting and auditing purposes.

   A summary of the <B>Tunnel-Client-Endpoint</B> Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Tag
      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a
      means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same tunnel.  If the value of the Tag field is greater than 0x00
      and less than or equal to 0x1F, it SHOULD be interpreted as
      indicating which tunnel (of several alternatives) this attribute
      pertains.  If the Tag field is greater than 0x1F, it SHOULD be
      interpreted as the first byte of the following String field.

   String
      The format of the address represented by the String field depends
      upon the value of the <A HREF="#Tunnel-Medium-Type">Tunnel-Medium-Type</A> attribute.

      If <A HREF="#Tunnel-Medium-Type">Tunnel-Medium-Type</A> is IPv4 (1), then this string is either the
      fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the tunnel client machine,
      or it is a "dotted-decimal" IP address.  Conformant
      implementations MUST support the dotted-decimal format and SHOULD
      support the FQDN format for IP addresses.

      If <A HREF="#Tunnel-Medium-Type">Tunnel-Medium-Type</A> is IPv6 (2), then this string is either the
      FQDN of the tunnel client machine, or it is a text representation
      of the address in either the preferred or alternate form [17].
      Conformant implementations MUST support the preferred form and
      SHOULD support both the alternate text form and the FQDN format
      for IPv6 addresses.

      If <A HREF="#Tunnel-Medium-Type">Tunnel-Medium-Type</A> is neither IPv4 nor IPv6, this string is a
      tag referring to configuration data local to the RADIUS client
      that describes the interface and medium-specific address to use.

<A NAME="Tunnel-Server-Endpoint"><H2>3.4.  Tunnel-Server-Endpoint</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

      This Attribute indicates the address of the server end of the
      tunnel.  The <B>Tunnel-Server-Endpoint</B> Attribute MAY be included (as
      a hint to the RADIUS server) in the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet and MUST
      be included in the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packet if the initiation of a
      tunnel is desired.  It SHOULD be included in <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request">Accounting-Request</A>
      packets which contain <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Acct-Status-Type">Acct-Status-Type</A> attributes with values of
      either Start or Stop and which pertain to a tunneled session.
      This Attribute, along with the <A HREF="#Tunnel-Client-Endpoint">Tunnel-Client-Endpoint</A> and Acct-
      Tunnel-Connection-ID Attributes [11], may be used to provide a
      globally unique means to identify a tunnel for accounting and
      auditing purposes.

<B>   Length</B>
      &gt;= 5

   Tag
      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a
      means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same tunnel.  Valid values for this field are 0x01 through 0x1F,
      inclusive.  If the value of the Tag field is greater than 0x00 and
      less than or equal to 0x1F, it SHOULD be interpreted as indicating
      which tunnel (of several alternatives) this attribute pertains;
      otherwise, the Tag field SHOULD be ignored.

   Salt
      The Salt field is two octets in length and is used to ensure the
      uniqueness of the encryption key used to encrypt each instance of
      the <B>Tunnel-Password</B> attribute occurring in a given <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A>
      packet.  The most significant bit (leftmost) of the Salt field
      MUST be set (1).  The contents of each Salt field in a given
      <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packet MUST be unique.

   String
      The plaintext String field consists of three logical sub-fields:
      the Data-Length and Password sub-fields (both of which are
      required), and the optional Padding sub-field.  The Data-Length
      sub-field is one octet in length and contains the length of the
      unencrypted Password sub-field.  The Password sub-field contains

      the actual tunnel password.  If the combined length (in octets) of
      the unencrypted Data-Length and Password sub-fields is not an even
      multiple of 16, then the Padding sub-field MUST be present.  If it
      is present, the length of the Padding sub-field is variable,
      between 1 and 15 octets.  The String field MUST be encrypted as
      follows, prior to transmission:

         Construct a plaintext version of the String field by
         concatenating the Data-Length and Password sub-fields.  If
         necessary, pad the resulting string until its length (in
         octets) is an even multiple of 16.  It is recommended that zero
         octets (0x00) be used for padding.  Call this plaintext P.

         Call the shared secret S, the pseudo-random 128-bit Request
         Authenticator (from the corresponding <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet) R,
         and the contents of the Salt field A.  Break P into 16 octet
         chunks p(1), p(2)...p(i), where i = len(P)/16.  Call the
         ciphertext blocks c(1), c(2)...c(i) and the final ciphertext C.
         Intermediate values b(1), b(2)...c(i) are required.  Encryption
         is performed in the following manner ('+' indicates
         concatenation):

            b(1) = MD5(S + R + A)    c(1) = p(1) xor b(1)   C = c(1)
            b(2) = MD5(S + c(1))     c(2) = p(2) xor b(2)   C = C + c(2)
                        .                      .
                        .                      .
                        .                      .
            b(i) = MD5(S + c(i-1))   c(i) = p(i) xor b(i)   C = C + c(i)

         The resulting encrypted String field will contain
         c(1)+c(2)+...+c(i).

      On receipt, the process is reversed to yield the plaintext String.

   Tag
      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a
      means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same tunnel.  If the value of the Tag field is greater than 0x00
      and less than or equal to 0x1F, it SHOULD be interpreted as
      indicating which tunnel (of several alternatives) this attribute
      pertains.  If the Tag field is greater than 0x1F, it SHOULD be
      interpreted as the first byte of the following String field.

   String
      This field must be present.  The group is represented by the
      String field.  There is no restriction on the format of group IDs.

<A NAME="Tunnel-Assignment-ID"><H2>3.7.  Tunnel-Assignment-ID</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

      This Attribute is used to indicate to the tunnel initiator the
      particular tunnel to which a session is to be assigned.  Some
      tunneling protocols, such as PPTP and L2TP, allow for sessions
      between the same two tunnel endpoints to be multiplexed over the
      same tunnel and also for a given session to utilize its own
      dedicated tunnel.  This attribute provides a mechanism for RADIUS
      to be used to inform the tunnel initiator (e.g. PAC, LAC) whether
      to assign the session to a multiplexed tunnel or to a separate
      tunnel.  Furthermore, it allows for sessions sharing multiplexed
      tunnels to be assigned to different multiplexed tunnels.

RFC 2868        RADIUS Tunnel Authentication Attributes        June 2000


      A particular tunneling implementation may assign differing
      characteristics to particular tunnels.  For example, different
      tunnels may be assigned different QOS parameters.  Such tunnels
      may be used to carry either individual or multiple sessions.  The
      <B>Tunnel-Assignment-ID</B> attribute thus allows the RADIUS server to
      indicate that a particular session is to be assigned to a tunnel
      that provides an appropriate level of service.  It is expected
      that any QOS-related RADIUS tunneling attributes defined in the
      future that accompany this attribute will be associated by the
      tunnel initiator with the ID given by this attribute.  In the
      meantime, any semantic given to a particular ID string is a matter
      left to local configuration in the tunnel initiator.

      The <B>Tunnel-Assignment-ID</B> attribute is of significance only to
      RADIUS and the tunnel initiator.  The ID it specifies is intended
      to be of only local use to RADIUS and the tunnel initiator.  The
      ID assigned by the tunnel initiator is not conveyed to the tunnel
      peer.

      This attribute MAY be included in the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A>.  The tunnel
      initiator receiving this attribute MAY choose to ignore it and
      assign the session to an arbitrary multiplexed or non-multiplexed
      tunnel between the desired endpoints.  This attribute SHOULD also
      be included in <A HREF="rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request">Accounting-Request</A> packets which contain Acct-
      Status-Type attributes with values of either Start or Stop and
      which pertain to a tunneled session.

      If a tunnel initiator supports the <B>Tunnel-Assignment-ID</B> Attribute,
      then it should assign a session to a tunnel in the following
      manner:

         If this attribute is present and a tunnel exists between the
         specified endpoints with the specified ID, then the session
         should be assigned to that tunnel.

         If this attribute is present and no tunnel exists between the
         specified endpoints with the specified ID, then a new tunnel
         should be established for the session and the specified ID
         should be associated with the new tunnel.

         If this attribute is not present, then the session is assigned
         to an unnamed tunnel.  If an unnamed tunnel does not yet exist
         between the specified endpoints then it is established and used
         for this and subsequent sessions established without the
         <B>Tunnel-Assignment-ID</B> attribute.  A tunnel initiator MUST NOT
         assign a session for which a <B>Tunnel-Assignment-ID</B> Attribute was
         not specified to a named tunnel (i.e. one that was initiated by
         a session specifying this attribute).

      This field must be present.  The tunnel ID is represented by the
      String field.  There is no restriction on the format of the ID.

<A NAME="Tunnel-Preference"><H2>3.8.  Tunnel-Preference</H2></a>

<B>   Description</B>

      If more than one set of tunneling attributes is returned by the
      RADIUS server to the tunnel initiator, this Attribute SHOULD be
      included in each set to indicate the relative preference assigned
      to each tunnel.  For example, suppose that Attributes describing
      two tunnels are returned by the server, one with a <A HREF="#Tunnel-Type">Tunnel-Type</A> of
      PPTP and the other with a <A HREF="#Tunnel-Type">Tunnel-Type</A> of L2TP.  If the tunnel
      initiator supports only one of the Tunnel-Types returned, it will
      initiate a tunnel of that type.  If, however, it supports both
      tunnel protocols, it SHOULD use the value of the <B>Tunnel-Preference</B>
      Attribute to decide which tunnel should be started.  The tunnel
      having the numerically lowest value in the Value field of this
      Attribute SHOULD be given the highest preference.  The values
      assigned to two or more instances of the <B>Tunnel-Preference</B>

      Attribute within a given <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packet MAY be identical.
      In this case, the tunnel initiator SHOULD use locally configured
      metrics to decide which set of attributes to use.  This Attribute
      MAY be included (as a hint to the server) in <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A>

<H2>5.  Security Considerations</H2>

   The <A HREF="#Tunnel-Password">Tunnel-Password</A> Attribute may contain information which should
   only be known to a tunnel endpoint.  However, the method used to hide
   the value of the attribute is such that intervening RADIUS proxies
   will have knowledge of the contents.  For this reason, the Tunnel-
   Password Attribute SHOULD NOT be included in <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packets
   which may pass through (relatively) untrusted RADIUS proxies.  In
   addition, the <A HREF="#Tunnel-Password">Tunnel-Password</A> Attribute SHOULD NOT be returned to an
   unauthenticated client; if the corresponding <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Request">Access-Request</A> packet
   did not contain a verified instance of the Signature Attribute [15],
   the <A HREF="rfc2865.html#Access-Accept">Access-Accept</A> packet SHOULD NOT contain an instance of the
   <A HREF="#Tunnel-Password">Tunnel-Password</A> Attribute.

   Tunnel protocols offer various levels of security, from none (e.g.,
   PPTP) to strong (e.g., IPSec).  Note, however, that in the compulsory
   tunneling case any security measures in place only apply to traffic
   between the tunnel endpoints.  In particular, end-users SHOULD NOT
   rely upon the security of the tunnel to protect their data;
   encryption and/or integrity protection of tunneled traffic MUST NOT
   be considered as a replacement for end-to-end security.

<H2>6.  IANA Considerations</H2>

   This document defines a number of "magic" numbers to be maintained by
