<h1>The FreeRADIUS Server Project</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS is the premiere open source RADIUS server.  Based on
current statistics, there are over 50,000 deployments of the software.
These deployments include small sites with 10 users, large-scale
enterprises with tens of thousands of users, and carrier-class
deployments with over 10 million users.  In total, the sites that we
know are using FreeRADIUS support nearly 100 million users.  The only
other servers that come close in terms of market share and/or number
of sites are ACS and IAS.</p>

<p>The server scales easily from embedded systems with small amounts
of memory to systems with millions of users.  It is fast, <a
href="features.html">flexible</a>, configurable, and supports more
authentication protocols than most commercial servers.  It includes
support for SQL, LDAP, RADIUS Proxying, failover, load balancing, and
nearly 100 vendor dictionary files.  It can perform authentications
via the PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, EAP-MD5, EAP-GTC, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS,
PEAPv0, LEAP, EAP-SIM, and Digest authentication protocols.  It has
reached a stable
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz"><!--#echo var="freeradius_major_version" --></a>
version
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz.sig">(sig)</a>
, with incremental improvements added in
each release.</p>

<p>The server is released under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1">GNU General Public
License</a> (GPL), which means that it is free to <a
href="getting.html">download</a> and <a
