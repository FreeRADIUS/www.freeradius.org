<h1>The FreeRADIUS Server Project</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS is the premiere open source RADIUS server.  Based on
current statistics, there are over 50,000 deployments of the software.
These deployments include small sites with 10 users, large-scale
enterprises with tens of thousands of users, and carrier-class
deployments with over 10 million users.  In total, the sites that we
know are using FreeRADIUS support nearly 100 million users.  The only
other servers that come close in terms of market share and/or number
of sites are ACS and IAS.</p>

<p>The server scales easily from embedded systems with small amounts
of memory to systems with millions of users.  It is fast, <a
href="features.html">flexible</a>, configurable, and supports more
authentication protocols than most commercial servers.  It includes
support for SQL, LDAP, RADIUS Proxying, failover, load balancing, and
nearly 100 vendor dictionary files.  It can perform authentications
via the PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, EAP-MD5, EAP-GTC, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS,
PEAPv0, LEAP, EAP-SIM, and Digest authentication protocols.  It has
reached a stable

version
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz.sig">(sig)</a>
, with incremental improvements added in
each release.</p>

<h2>Recent News</h2>

<span class="date">2006.03.05</span> Version <a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz"><!--#echo var="freeradius_version" --></a>
has been released.  The focus of this release is stability.

<h3>Feature Improvements</h3
<ul>
<li>Added more dictionaries</li>
<li>Dictionary files now MUST NOT be globally writable.</li>
<li>Configuration files now MUST NOT be globally writable.</li>
<li>Be more aggressive about freeing memory on clean exit.</li>
<li> Updated rlm_python.</li>
<li>Added another experimental SQL IP Pool module</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corrected base64 decoding in rlm_pap</li>
<li>Don't retransmit accounting packets.  The NAS should do this.</li>
<li>Handle Client-Error in EAP-SIM.  (Closes #419)</li>
<li>Port OpenSSL locking fixes from CVS head.  This makes PEAP more stable on some systems.</li>
<li>Require Message-Authenticator in Status-Server packets.</li>
<li>Correct Tunnel-Medium-Type VALUEs in dictionary.rfc2868.</li>
<li> Increase buffer size for dynamic expansion, which allows longer SQL queries.  (Closes #405)</li>
<li>Use correct line number when there's a parse error in one of the configuration sections. (Closes #421)</li>
<li>Terminate SSL sessions in EAP on error, rather than continuing in some cases.</li>
<li>Increase buffer size to allow parsing of long octet strings,</li>
<li>Fix string termination on xlat in rlm_perl.</li>
</ul>

A number of additional issues have been fixed due to a scan provided
by <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a>.  These issues do
not affect the servers performance or stability, but are in the
category of items we should fix anyways.  Not all of the issues have
been fixed in this release, but all have been examined for potential
side effects.  We expect future releases to contain fixes for
lower-priority bugs found during the scan.

License</a> (GPL), which means that it is free to <a
