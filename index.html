<h1>The FreeRADIUS Project</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS has developed the industry leading RADIUS server.  Based
on current statistics, there are over 50,000 deployments of the
software.  These deployments include small sites with 10 users,
large-scale enterprises with tens of thousands of users, and
carrier-class deployments with over 10 million users.  In total, the
sites that we know are using FreeRADIUS support nearly <a
href="press/survey.html#users">100 million</a> users.  The only other
servers that come close in terms of market share and/or number of
sites are products from Cisco and Microsoft.</p>

<p>The server scales easily from embedded systems with small amounts
of memory to systems with millions of users.  It is fast, <a
href="features.html">flexible</a>, configurable, and supports more
authentication protocols than most commercial servers.  It includes
support for SQL, LDAP, RADIUS Proxying, failover, load balancing, and
nearly 100 vendor dictionary files.  It can perform authentications
via the PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, EAP-MD5, EAP-GTC, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS,
PEAPv0, LEAP, EAP-SIM, and Digest authentication protocols.  It has
reached a stable
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.bz2"><!--#echo var="freeradius_version" --></a>
version
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.bz2.sig">(sig)</a>
, with incremental improvements added in
each release.</p>

<p>
The project is growing to include a <a
href="/freeradius-client/">client library</a> that is BSD licensed.
There is also a <a href="/pam_radius_auth/">PAM</a> library, and an
Apache <a href="/mod_auth_radius/">module</a>.
