<h1>The FreeRADIUS Server Project</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS is the premiere open source RADIUS server.  Based on
current statistics, there are over 50,000 deployments of the software.
These deployments include small sites with 10 users, large-scale
enterprises with tens of thousands of users, and carrier-class
deployments with over 10 million users.  In total, the sites that we
know are using FreeRADIUS support nearly 100 million users.  The only
other servers that come close in terms of market share and/or number
of sites are ACS and IAS.</p>

<p>The server scales easily from embedded systems with small amounts
of memory to systems with millions of users.  It is fast, <a
href="features.html">flexible</a>, configurable, and supports more
authentication protocols than most commercial servers.  It includes
support for SQL, LDAP, RADIUS Proxying, failover, load balancing, and
nearly 100 vendor dictionary files.  It can perform authentications
via the PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, EAP-MD5, EAP-GTC, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS,
PEAPv0, LEAP, EAP-SIM, and Digest authentication protocols.  It has
reached a stable

version
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz.sig">(sig)</a>
, with incremental improvements added in
each release.</p>

<span class="date">2006.04.12</span> Version <a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz"><!--#echo var="freeradius_version" --></a>
<a href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org:/pub/radius/freeradius-<!--#echo var="freeradius_version" -->.tar.gz.sig">(sig)</a>

<h3>Feature Improvements</h3
<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corrected typo in rlm_pap.c (closes #440)</li>
<li>Corrected typo in src/main/auth.c (closes #437)</li>
<li>Suppress SSL error messages if error is zero.  (closes #436)</li>

<li>Corrected nearly 30 bugs found by Coverity
See also http://scan.coverity.com</li>
<li>Don't die on HUP.  Instead leak memory (sorry).  After a few
hundred HUP's, the server will have leaked a few megabytes of
memory, and you should probably re-start it.  It's ugly, but
better than dying.  (Closes #426)</li>
