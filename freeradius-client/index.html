<h1>The FreeRADIUS Client Library</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS Client is a framework and library for writing RADIUS
Clients which additionally includes radlogin, a flexible RADIUS aware
login replacement, a command line program to send RADIUS accounting
records and a utility to query the status of a RADIUS server. All of
these programs are based on a library that lets you develop a
RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines of C code. It is highly
portable and runs on Linux, many BSD variants and Solaris.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Radiusclient">Wiki</a>
for more information, including <a

<h2>Version 1.1.7</h2>

<p>After many years, version 1.1.7 has been released.  It has a large
number of fixes, but is still compatible with the code from 1.1.6.  The ChangeLog is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow "configure --with-nettle" to use nettle MD5
    implementation.  Patch from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
</li><li>Clean up generation of random numbers.
    Patch from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
</li><li>Update BSD license as permitted by Christos Zoulas.
</li><li>Define PW_MAX_MSG_SIZE for maximum message sice.
    Patch from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
</li><li>Allow the dictionary file parser to understand
    BEGIN-VENDOR / END-VENDOR as with FreeRADIUS server.
    Patch from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
</li><li>Added support for IPv6.
    Patch from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
</li><li>Don't crash if a config option is unset.
    Patch from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
</li><li>Fix encoding of "date" attributes.  Patch from
    Christian Schoch.
</li><li>Build fixes from Sven Neuhaus, Ghennadi Procopciuc,
    Daniel Pocock, and gureedo.
</li><li>Fix memory leaks.  Patches from Alex Massover,
    William King, gureedo, and FreeSWITCH.
</li><li>Fixes to retry algorithm.  Patch from Lewis Adam.
</li><li>Zero out secret fields.  Patch from Scott Neugroschl.
</li><li>Update the dictionaries.  Patches from Bogdan-Andrei Iancu
    and gureedo.
</li><li>Make the library thread-safe.  Based on a patch from
    Alex Massover.
</li><li>Made rc_avpair_log thread-safe by using a buffer supplied
    by the caller.  Patch from Alex Massover.
</li><li>Removed lock file for sequence number.  It isn't needed.
</li><li>Use poll() where possible to avoid issues with FD_SETSIZE.
    Patch from Alfred E. Heggestad.
</li><li>Set Acct-Delay-Time in Accounting-Request packets.
    Patch from Alfred E. Heggestad.

</ul>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>Unlike the FreeRADIUS Server which is available under the GPL, or
libfreeradius which is available under the LGPL, the FreeRADIUS Client
library is distributed under the BSD license. This is to facilitate
the maximum possible use of correct, up-to-date, maintained code in as
many other RADIUS Client implementations as possible.</p>

<p>The FreeRADIUS team collectively has decades of RADIUS experience,
and is active in defining new <a
href="/press/2007.html#rfc5080">RADIUS standards</a>.  We have worked
with many different RADIUS servers and clients, and know what it takes
to make a client that is robust, feature-rich, and inter-operable.  To
that end, we are releasing this library under the BSD license, to
lower your costs in developing a RADIUS client, and to increase the
likelihood that your client will inter-operate with every other
implementation.</p>

<p><center><em>We want you use this code in your application whether it
is Open Source or not.</em></center></p>

<p>Please see the COPYRIGHT file in the radiusclient source code for
more details.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Radiusclient used to live at http://www.cityline.net/~lf/radius/ but
seems to be no longer maintained (Tarballs are still available from
ftp://ftp.cityline.net/pub/radiusclient/). It does however still ship
with some Linux distributions including SUSE Linux.</p>

<p>A fork of the original radiusclient called radiusclient-ng is used as
the basis of the RADIUS support in SER and OpenSER.</p>

<p>In late 2006 it was decided that the FreeRADIUS Project should adopt
the latest code from radiusclient-ng cvs as the basis of a new
FreeRADIUS client package. The intention is to roll some of the client
functionality of the FreeRADIUS server into this separate client
package and to make the FreeRADIUS suite a one stop shop for all
people wishing to use and develop RADIUS related applications.</p>

<p>The first version released by the FreeRADIUS project is 1.1.5. This
version fixes an MD5 related endian issue and introduces a client
configuration framework to the library which lends itself to allowing
embedded radius client functionality. Development of the codebase is
ongoing.</p>
