<h1>The FreeRADIUS Client Library</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS Client is a framework and library for writing RADIUS
Clients which additionally includes radlogin, a flexible RADIUS aware
login replacement, a command line program to send RADIUS accounting
records and a utility to query the status of a RADIUS server. All of
these programs are based on a library that lets you develop a
RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines of C code. It is highly
portable and runs on Linux, many BSD variants and Solaris.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Radiusclient">Wiki</a>
for more information, including <a
href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/freeradius/freeradius-client-1.1.5.tar.bz2">download</a>
links.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>Unlike the FreeRADIUS Server which is available under the GPL, or
libfreeradius which is available under the LGPL, the FreeRADIUS Client
library is distributed under the BSD license. This is to facilitate
the maximum possible use of correct, up-to-date, maintained code in as
many other RADIUS Client implementations as possible.</p>

<p>The FreeRADIUS team collectively has decades of RADIUS experience,
and is active in defining new <a
href="/press/2007.html#rfc5080">RADIUS standards</a>.  We have worked
with many different RADIUS servers and clients, and know what it takes
to make a client that is robust, feature-rich, and inter-operable.  To
that end, we are releasing this library under the BSD license, to
lower your costs in developing a RADIUS client, and to increase the
likelihood that your client will inter-operate with every other
implementation.</p>

<p><center><em>We want you use this code in your application whether it
is Open Source or not.</em></center></p>

<p>Please see the COPYRIGHT file in the radiusclient source code for
more details.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Radiusclient used to live at http://www.cityline.net/~lf/radius/ but
seems to be no longer maintained (Tarballs are still available from
ftp://ftp.cityline.net/pub/radiusclient/). It does however still ship
with some Linux distributions including SUSE Linux.</p>

<p>A fork of the original radiusclient called radiusclient-ng is used as
the basis of the RADIUS support in SER and OpenSER.</p>

<p>In late 2006 it was decided that the FreeRADIUS Project should adopt
the latest code from radiusclient-ng cvs as the basis of a new
FreeRADIUS client package. The intention is to roll some of the client
functionality of the FreeRADIUS server into this separate client
package and to make the FreeRADIUS suite a one stop shop for all
people wishing to use and develop RADIUS related applications.</p>

<p>The first version released by the FreeRADIUS project is 1.1.5. This
version fixes an MD5 related endian issue and introduces a client
configuration framework to the library which lends itself to allowing
embedded radius client functionality. Development of the codebase is
ongoing.</p>
