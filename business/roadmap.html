<h1>Development Roadmap</h1>

<p>The roadmap for the server is loosely defined.  However, we are
actively looking for sponsors for new features.</p>

<h2>WiMAX</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.wimaxforum.org/home/">WiMAX</a> is growing in
popularity.  The WiMAX specification for RADIUS has a few differences
from the historical Vendor-Specific Attribute (VSA) format.  The
protocol parser currently in the server does not support this new
format.</p>

<p><em>Scope of Work:</em> Modify the protocol handlers to parse and
generate WiMAX attributes.  Update the server core to handle
attributes longer than 253 bytes in length.</p>

<p><em>Estimated effort:</em> To parse and generate WiMAX attributes,
approximately a thousand lines of code.  About the same effort again
to update the protocol core to handle long attributes.  The total cost
is likely less than purchasing a commercial server that includes WiMAX
support.</p>

href="mailto:wimax@freeradius.org">wimax@freeradius.org</a></p>

<h2>3GPP2</h2>

<p><em>Scope of Work:</em> Update the protocol handlers to parse and
generate 3GPP2 attributes.</p>

<p><em>Estimated effort:</em> Approximately a thousand lines of code.
The total cost is likely less than purchasing a commercial server that
includes 3GPP2 support.</p>

<p><em>Contact:</em> <a
href="mailto:3gpp2@freeradius.org">3gpp2@freeradius.org</a></p>

<h2>Change of Authorization (CoA)</h2>

<p><em>Scope of Work:</em> Update the server core to accept, process,
and generate CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets.</p>

<p><em>Estimated effort:</em> Significant.  Three to six (3-6) weeks of
effort.</p>

<p><em>Contact:</em> <a href="mailto:coa@freeradius.org">coa@freeradius.org</a></p>

<h2>Native port to Windows</h2>

<p><em>Scope of Work:</em> Update the server to build under <a
href="http://www.mingw.org">MingW</a>.  Add native Windows
implementations of some features (threads, signals, run as service,
etc.)</p>

<p><em>Estimated effort:</em> Three to four (3-4) weeks of work.  The
end result will be a native Windows binary that can be run as a
service on Windows.</p>

<p><em>Contact:</em> <a
href="mailto:win32@freeradius.org">win32@freeradius.org</a></p>

<h2>Active Directory integration</h2>

<p><em>Scope of Work:</em> Once the server runs natively on Windows,
use internal Windows API's to obtain user passwords.  This information
is not available to programs running elsewhere on the network.</p>

<p><em>Estimated effort:</em> Three to four (3-4) weeks of work.  The
end result will be a module that will look up a user and obtain their
password from the internal Active Directory database.  This
functionality will be equivalent to the <tt>unix</tt> module on Posix
systems, which uses the user name as a key to obtain the password from
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt></p>

<h2>Change of Authorization (CoA)</h2>

<p><em>Scope of Work:</em> Update the server core to accept, process,
and generate CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets.</p>

<p><em>Estimated effort:</em> Significant.  Three to six (3-6) weeks of
effort.</p>

<h2>Release 2.0</h2>

<p>This release is almost finished, and contains a large number of
fixes over the 1.x release stream.  The sponsor will be announced in
conjunction with the final release of 2.0.<p>

<p>We expect that once this version has been released, 1.x will go
into "maintenance" mode, where the only changes will be critical bug
fixes.</p>

<p>The following is a partial list of new and updated functionality in
2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.</li>
<li>A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.
See <tt>man unlang</tt> for a complete description.</li>
<li>Virtual servers are now supported.  This permits clear separation
of policies.  See raddb/sites-available/README</li>
<li>EAP-TLS (PEAP, EAP-TTLS) and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
See <tt>raddb/certs/README</tt> for details.</li>
<li>Proxying is much more configurable than before.
See proxy.conf for documentation on pools, and new config items.</li>
<li>Full support for IPv6.</li>
<li>Much more complete support for the RADIUS SNMP MIBs.</li>
<li>HUP now works.  However, only some modules are re-loaded,
and the server configuation is <em>not</em> reloaded.</li>
<li>There is now a "check configuration" option.  See <tt>man
radiusd</tt> for functionality and limitations.</li>
<li><tt>radrelay</tt> functionality is now included in the server core.
See <tt>raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server</tt></li>
<li><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN_Management_Policy_Server"VMPS</a>
support.  It is minimal, but functional.</li>
<li>Cleaned up internal API's and names, including library names.</li>
</ul>
