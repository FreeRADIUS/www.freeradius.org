<h1>Testimonials and Success Stories</h1>

<p> The following are a just a few of the success stories people have
of using the server in production environments</p>


<UL><!-- put new stuff at the end! -->

  <LI><B>Nicolas Baradakis - Cegetel</B>
  <P>
    I'm working as a consultant at 
    Cegetel, the second largest telecommunications operator in
    France: we handle hundreds of thousands ADSL users, Wifi hotspots
    in main railway stations, and we also rent RADIUS services to
    companies who connect their agencies or their mobile workers
    through our network.
  </P>
  <P>
    My co-worker <B>Thomas Marchesseau</B> designed a setup based on
    FreeRADIUS, LVS (Linux Virtual Server) and MySQL replication. The
    main idea is to have the NAS send the requests to a virtual IP
    owned by a couple of LVS, which distribute the load on the pool
    of FreeRADIUS servers.
    <OL>
      <LI> This setup is <I>redundant</I>, there is no point of
      failure: the LVS periodically checks whether the servers are
      alive, and keepalived runs the backup LVS when the master is
      down.</LI>
      <LI> This setup is <I>scalable</I>: as the traffic increases,
      you can add new machines in the pool without restarting the
      service. (the performance will proportionally rise)
      <UL>
        <LI>The LVS divides the RADIUS load between more machines.</LI>
        <LI>The MySQL replication ensures there is no bottleneck on
        the database.</LI>
      </UL></LI>
      <LI> This setup is <I>inexpensive</I>: we are using free
      software and we don't need specific hardware, just ordinary PC
      are fine. Even if a machine breaks down, the service is still
      running on the remaining machines.</LI>
    </OL>
  </P>
  <P>
    FreeRADIUS offers not only a high level of performance and
    availability. It also has more <I>flexibility</I> than any
    commercial product. You can do a lot of things through the config
    files, and easily write plugins to do the most esoteric things
    whithin the server. Thanks to FreeRADIUS we are able to manage
    complex situations: we have a lot of heterogeneous services which
    send requests to the same pool of proxies. Some of them requires
    specific actions on the RADIUS packets.
  </P>
  <P>
    We were able to match our needs because the project is <I>open
    source</I>. Indeed, we were able to freely add the features that
    we found useful. We can also quickly fix some bugs (it happens)
    without waiting for someone else to write a patch. All contributions
    from Cegetel are submitted on the project's mailing list, and some
    of them are now available in the current version of FreeRADIUS.

<LI><B>Kostas Kalevras - Greek School Network</B>
<P>
We have 4500 schools connecting through ISDN lines, 30000 dialup
accounts, a lot of ADSL connections and 51 access servers. Two of them
are Cisco 5800 and the rest are Cisco 3640/3660. In total around 5000 lines.
<br>
We have two radius servers, one serving the South of Greece (including Attika
which hosts the main 5800 access server with 600 lines) and the other serving
the North of Greece (which includes the other 5800 with 300 lines). Both radius
servers act as a backup for the other.
<br>
The user database is in LDAP (iPlanet DS5.1) while the accounting is maintained
in MySQL+InnoDB databases. Each server replicates the accounting information
through radrelay to the other one. That way we maintain full accounting on each
server and can enforce national double login detection and also have nice
redundancy.
<br>
The MySQL databases are hosted on the same machines as are the radius
servers (meaning we have 2 MySQL/RADIUS servers). The LDAP servers are hosted
on different machines.
The machines are Sun V120 with 1GB RAM and Solaris 8 each.
<br>
We do a lot of attribute rewriting through the attr_rewrite module and we have
also enabled the detail accounting module for radrelay to work.
<br>
The schools connect on demand (when there is a request for something from the
internet) so we get a *lot* of connections. For weekdays we get around 100000
connections per day. For each connection we get:
Access-Request,Accounting-Start,Accounting-Stop. In other words
the servers need to handle 3 RADIUS packets per connection.
<br>
Here is a typical top output. As you can see freeradius has no problem handling
the load.

  <LI><B> Jeff Carneal - Apex Internet</B>
     <P>
Using late-2000 freeradius snapshot to authenticate ~25k ppp users. All users stored
in a single file and authenticated via rlm_fastusers. Mysql accounting through direct
mysql API in rlm_sql. Currently not doing simultaneous use checks, though it should
be easy to implement.
   </P>

    <P>
I'm currently running FreeRadius with rlm_ldap in production environment, with failover
setup to use rlm_pam as backup.

    We chose FreeRADIUS because of it's simplicity, flexibility, and
    cost.  We investigated everything from the older Cistron RADIUS
    (and all the other RADIUS servers listed on the FreeRADIUS site)
    to multiple commercial servers, to replace our existing commercial
    system.
    </p>
    Our current comercial RADIUS server has restrictions on it's
    capabilities, and since our customer base has expanded, we would
    have to upgrade our license in order to handle our increased
    load.   This upgrade would have cost us several thousand dollars.
    </P>
    <p>
    With that cost in mind, we decided to look at what else existed.
    We investigated all the others, freeware and otherwise, and in the
    end chose FreeRADIUS for several reasons:

    <ol>
    <li>You can't beat the cost. :-)
    </li>

     <li>In our environment, we had Linux boxes already available and
     in place which could do double-duty as RADIUS servers.  To use a
     product like our existing server, not only would it cost us
     money, but we would have to buy additional hardware just to run
     the software.
     </li>

     <li>FreeRADIUS, of all the open source products, seemed to be where the
     future was at.  Modular design, simple configuration...of the open
     source packages, it definitely seemed the way to go.
     </li>

     <li>The variety of ways in which FreeRADIUS can interface with
     data stores (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, LDAP, etc.) caught our
     attention, as we run various platforms here.  We have Oracle
     databases, MySQL databases, LDAP servers, you name it.  The fact
     we had this kind of flexibility with FreeRADIUS appealed to us.
     </li>

     <li>Our network design involved two RADIUS servers, one in each of our
     core locations, requiring a method of keeping usernames/passwords
     in sync.  Our customer data resides in an Oracle database running on
     an AIX node.  By running FreeRADIUS hooked into MySQL, we could tap
     MySQL's replication feature, running a copy of MySQL on the AIX
     node (acting as master), with the RADIUS servers acting as slaves.
     This kind of replication/synchronization in the commercial RADIUS
     world requires several thousand dollar packages.  We did it for a
     sum total of $0.00 USD!
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    And though some would rightly argue that using 'free' software
     often costs a company more in man-hours, we are an agency
     with salaried staff, so there is no additional cost in our case,
     as the overriding emphasis was on keeping out of pocket expenses
     to a minimum.  Our time is already paid for.
    </p>

    <p>
    But even if that wasn't the case, I believe I would still use
    FreeRADIUS, simply because it IS just so darn flexible.  The
    synchronization design mentioned above was not implemented in the
    end, mostly due to other considerations.  That is, our current
    setup involved sucking data out of the Oracle customer database,
    then having Perl scripts massage that data for export to both
    our peers and to our old Kerberos servers (still used for certain
    dialup functions).  To keep conversion time down, the decision was
    made that, at least for now, the solution would involve simply
    adjusting the Perl scripts and blowing out the data to the MySQL
    servers instead.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using tools such as FreeRADIUS gave us options I do not believe canned,
    commercial packages offer.  Yes, it can be a little more elbow grease.
    And yes, the lack of a nice GUI for those looking for a canned solution
    IS a concern.  But there is a <A href="dialupadmin.html">web
    front end</a> which is a good start.
    </p>

  <LI><b>Networld + Interop Las Vegas 2003</b>
<P>
FreeRADIUS was used in the InteropNet Labs during the show, in order
to demonstrate Wireless LAN security.  The <a href="doc/ni_2003_ilabs_wlan_sec_overview.pdf">overview document</a> does not mention FreeRADIUS in the text,
but it is one of the seven RADIUS servers in the green cloud at the bottom
of page 1.
</p>
<p>
The wireless clients used in the demonstration included Cisco, MAC OSX, Windows, etc.
