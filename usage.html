<p>We hope that you don't have any problems, installing FreeRADIUS,
but if you do, read the <a
href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/faq">FAQ</a> first to see
if it's happened to many other people. If you don't find the answer
there, then ask the <em>freeradius-users</em> mailing list.</p>

<h2>Getting the software</h2>

<p>There are two ways of getting the server, and <a
href="getting.html">both are described on our instruction
page.</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Here's the quick-and-dirty step-by-step guide.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a
  href="ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/">Download</a> a
  tarball</li>

  <li>Extract it with gunzip and tar</li>

  <li>Run <code>./configure</code> in the top directory, with
  your chosen parameters</li>

  <li>Run <code>make</code></li>

  <li>As root, run <code>make install</code></li>

  <li>Edit <code>etc/raddb/radiusd.conf</code> to suit your
  needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions or problems, <em>please</em> read the
following  files:</p>
<ul>
 <A HREF="radiusd/README">README</a><br>
 <A HREF="radiusd/INSTALL">INSTALL</a><br>
 <A HREF="radiusd/doc/README">doc/README</a><br>
 <A HREF="radiusd/raddb/radiusd.conf.in">radiusd.conf</a><br>
 Anything else in the <A HREF="radiusd/doc/">doc/</a> directory, or the sample configuration files in the <A HREF="radiusd/raddb/">raddb/</a> directory.<br>
</ul>

<p>Many of the modules are documented <em>only</em> in the comments in
the <A HREF="radiusd/raddb/radiusd.conf.in">radiusd.conf</a> file,
sorry.  If this is insufficient, feel free to submit changes or
updates.</p>

<p>If the server is installed properly on your local system, you
should be able to type <code>man rlm_foo</code> to see the "man" page
for the module "foo".  See also the <a href="/radiusd/man/">online man
pages</a> for hypertext versions.</p>

<p>Not all modules have "man" pages, so please read the <a
href="raddb/radiusd.conf.in">radiusd.conf</a> file for additional
documentation.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>There is plenty of documentation in the <code>doc/</code>
directory, but it is not complete as of yet.  We're working on it,
but slowly.  As always, patches are welcome.</p>

<p>Have we mentioned the <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596003226/freeradiusorg-20">
RADIUS book</a>?  It covers a number of topics which aren't in the
FreeRADIUS documentation, including detailed descriptions of the
RADIUS attributes.<p>

<p>The RADIUS <A HREF="rfc/">RFCs</A> are available on-line.
They are not meant for the average user, but they are the
<em>definitive</em> reference for RADIUS.  Any RADIUS protocol
questions can usually be answered by reading the RFCs.<p>

<p>For a quick reference, the RADIUS <A
HREF="rfc/attributes.html">attributes</a> are listed here.  The
names in the list link to the definition of the attributes in the
RFCs.  If you're looking for an attribute to do something, or
want to know what an attribute does, then the <A
HREF="rfc/attributes.html">attribute</a> list is the best place to
start.</p>

<p>There are additional attributes not defined in the RFCs.
These are usually vendor-specific attributes, and there is little
to no documentation available outside of the vendor, for those
attributes.  The dictionary files (in the <code>share/</code>
directory) which are distributed with FreeRADIUS list the names of
many vendor-specific attributes, and often contain pointers to the
vendor web site which documents those attributes.

<h2><a id="help" name="help">Getting help</a></h2>

<p>If you've read the documentation, and still aren't
satisfied, you should consider joining the
<em>freeradius-users</em> list.</p>

<h3>mailing list</h3>

<p>A lot of the users of FreeRADIUS are on the
<em>freeradius-users</em> list, and it's an excellent source of
advice and information. There's a list of <a
href="list/users.html">rules one must follow</a> along with the
instructions on how to join.</p>

<p>There is a mailing list for developers too, but it's for
programmers and documentation-writers only. Don't ask a ``how
do I'' question there, as it'll be ignored or flamed. There's a
user-list for a reason; use it.</p>

<h3>reporting bugs</h3>

<p>If you and the list think you've found a bug, please report
it to the developers via the <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/list/users.html">mailing list.</a>
Also, make sure that the version you're using is the most recently
released version of FreeRADIUS, and that you don't have any local
patches applied..</p>
