<li><span class="date">2014.04.08</span> <a name="heartbleed"> - OpenSSL <a href="heartbleed.com">heartbleed</a> bug.
<p>
OpenSSL has a major security issue, seen in
to <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160
">CVE-2014-0160</a>.  The issue mainly affects servers such as SMTPS
or HTTPS, which allow random IP addresses to connect to them via TLS.
Those sites must assume that all information available to the system
using TLS has been compromised.</p>

<p>FreeRADIUS is <em>not vulnerable</em> in any EAP method, for any
version of FreeRADIUS.  All of the certificates, keys, and passwords
used by FreeRADIUS for EAP are safe and secure.</p>

<p>The code in FreeRADIUS which interacts with TLS expects to see TLS
alerts, handshakes, and application data.  Any other TLS content (such
as a heartbeat) is treated as an error, and the session is terminated.
In version 3,
see <a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.0.x/src/main/tls.c">tls.c</a>,
function tls_ack_handler().  In version 2, the code is
in <a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v2.x.x/src/modules/rlm_eap/libeap/eap_tls.c">eap_tls.c</a>.
</p>

<p>Version 3 also
implements <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6614">RADIUS over
TLS</a>, which opens up new vectors for attack.  However, the incoming
connection handler re-uses the TLS code mentioned above.  Therefore a
FreeRADIUS server accepting RADIUS over TLS connections is <em>not
vulnerable</em> to this issue.</p>

<p>However, the outgoing connection handler uses a different code
path, which calls SSL_read().  The implementation of SSL_Read() allows
any content, including the problematic heartbeats.  Therefore, a
FreeRADIUS server which opens outgoing RADIUS over TLS
connections <b>is vulnerable</b> to this attack.  A malicious home
server could exploit this issue to steal secrets from the FreeRADIUS
proxy.</p>

<p>Our belief is that this is a relatively minor issue for FreeRADIUS
administrators.  Most versions of the server, and most configurations
are not vulnerable to any issue.  For the ones which are vulnerable
(version 2, outgoing RADIUS over TLS), the connections are made only
to pre-configured, and well-known home servers.</p>

<p>That is, the only people who can exploit this issue are people who
are already known to you, and who are trusted to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Administrators can detect "heartbleed" attacks by looking in their
logs for a message containing the text <tt>Invalid ACK received:
24</tt>.  If such a message is seen, it means that the attack was
prevented.</p>

<p>We suggest that all administrators upgrade all of their systems to
a version of OpenSSL which is not vulnerable to this attack.  Sites
which allow random IPs to connect to a TLS server (e.g. SMTPS or
HTTPS) should assume that all information available to those servers
has been stolen from those systems.  This information includes user
credentials, keys for private certificates, cookies sent over HTTPS,
etc.</p>

<p>We have updated FreeRADIUS (all versions) so that it refuses to
start when it detects the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
Administrators can over-ride this check by
setting <tt>allow_vulnerable_openssl = yes</tt> in
the <tt>security</tt> subsection of radiusd.conf.</p>

<li><span class="date">2012.11.10</span> <a name="CVE-2011-4966"> - Unix module allows expired passwords
<p>
The CVE notification
is <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4966">CVE-2011-4966</a>
(note: it is still marked "private" for unknown reasons).
</p>
<p>
It was found that the "unix" module ignored the password expiration
setting in "/etc/shadow".  The default configuration does not use the
"unix" module, so there is no issue for most deployments.  However, if
the server was configured to use this module for authentication, users
with an expired password could successfully authenticate, even though
their access should have been denied.

We recommend managing users in a database, instead of leveraging
/etc/passwd.  The fact that a user has login access to a machine does
not necessarily mean that they can use RADIUS for other kinds of
network access.
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="date">2012.09.10</span> <a name="CVE-2012-3547"> - Overflow in EAP-TLS for 2.1.10, 2.1.11 and 2.1.12.
<p>
The CVE notification
is <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3547">CVE-2012-3547</a>.
The issue was found by Timo Warns, and communicated to
security@freeradius.org.  A sample exploit for the issue was included
in the notification.
</p>
<p>
We recommend all administrators using EAP and 2.1.10, 2.1.11, 2.1.12, or the
git "master' branch upgrade immediately.
</p>
<p> The vulnerability was created in <a href="https://github.com/FreERADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/a368a6f4f4aaf">commit a368a6f4f4aaf</a> on August
18, 2010.  Vulnerable versions include 2.1.10, 2.1.11, and 2.1.12.
Also anyone running the git "master" branch after August 18, 2010 is
vulnerable.</p>

<p>All sites using TLS-based EAP methods and the above versions are
vulnerable.  The only configuration change which can avoid the issue is
to disable EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP.</p>

<p>An external attacker can use this vulnerability to over-write the
stack frame of the RADIUS server, and cause it to crash.  In addition,
more sophisticated attacks may gain additional privileges on the
system running the RADIUS server.</p>

<p>This attack does not require local network access to the RADIUS
server.  It can be done by an attacker through a WiFi Access Point, so
long as the Access Point is configured to use 802.1X authentication
with the RADIUS server.</p>

<p>We scanned the rlm_eap_tls.c file with the LLVM checker-267, taken
from http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/.  It did not find this issue.
However, a Coverity scan did discover it.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="date">2012.04.19</span> <a name="openssl"> - Versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable to malformed certificates.
<p>
The CVE notification
is <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-2110">CVE-2012-2110</a>.
</p>
<p>
We recommend all administrators using certificates with FreeRADIUS
upgrade their OpenSSL to a secure version.  For details, see the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt">OpenSSL notification</a>
</p>
<p>We emphasize that this is <em>not</em> a bug in FreeRADIUS.  FreeRADIUS uses OpenSSL for many of it's cryptographic operations, and as such, is at the mercy of any problems in OpenSSL.</p>
</li>


<li><span class="date">2011.09.22</span> <a name="2.1.11"> - Manually
enabling OCSP has no effect.  This issue is applicable only to version
2.1.11.
<p>
The CVE notification
is <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2701">CVE-2011-2701</a>.
The discoverer notified us and sent a patch.
</p>
<p>
The OCSP functionality in 2.1.11 could be enabled manually, but it
would never mark certificates as revoked.  As such, it did not behave
as expected
</p>
<p>
Since this issue requires manually enabling OCSP, it's severity is
low.  The recommended solution is to upgrade to version 2.1.12.
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="date">2010.10.08</span> <a name="2.1.9"> - Code
modifications to the server can cause it to crash.  This issue is
applicable only to version 2.1.9.
<p>
The CVE notification
is <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3696">CVE-2010-3696</a>.
As with many such notifications, the issuer did not communicate with
us before releasing the alleged vulnerability.  We also disagree with
their description of the problem.
</p>
<p>
The DHCP functionality in 2.1.9 is <em>not</em> enabled by default.
Enabling it requires code modifications, a complete re-build and
re-install of the server, and a manual enabling of DHCP in the
configuration.  Further, the DHCP functionality is marked
"experimental" in this release.  As such, it should be used only on
trusted networks.
</p>
<p>
This issue is exploitable whenever FreeRADIUS has had DHCP
functionality enabled, and where the administrator has manually
configured the server to accept DHCP packets.  Any DHCP packet with a
"Relay Agent" sub-option can cause FreeRADIUS to enter an infinite
loop.
</p>
<p>
Our recommendation is to run experimental features only in trusted
networks.
</p>
</li>


<li><span class="date">2010.10.08</span> <a name="2.1.9"> - If
FreeRADIUS depends on a database, and the database goes down for
extended periods, the server may crash.  This issue applies to versions
2.0.0 through 2.1.9.  This issue is not externally exploitable.
<p>
The CVE notification
is <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3697">CVE-2010-3697</a>.
As with many such notifications, the issuer did not communicate with
us before releasing the alleged vulnerability.  We also disagree with
their description of the problem.
</p>
<p>
The short description of this problem is that any administrator who
can (a) take the database down, or (b) disrupt communication between
FreeRADIUS and the database can prevent FreeRADIUS from operating
correctly.  This result should not be a surprise.
</p>
<p>
There is no possibility for privilege escalation, or access to the
system running FreeRADIUS.  The issue is marked "network exploitable"
in the CVE database because it requires the network to
be <em>down</em> for the attack to work.
</p>
<p>
Our recommendation is to upgrade to the latest version of the server.
We also recommend that mission-critical systems be monitored.  If they
go offline for extended periods, they should be restarted.
</p>
</li>

      <li><span class="date">2009.09.09</span> <a
name="1.1.7">v1.1.7</a> - Anyone who can send packets to the server
can crash it by sending a Tunnel-Password attribute in an
Access-Request packet.  This vulnerability is not otherwise
exploitable.  We have released 1.1.8 to correct this vulnerability.
<p>
This issue is similar to the previous Tunnel-Password issue noted
below.  The vulnerable versions are 1.1.3 through 1.1.7.  Version 2.x
is not affected.
</p>
      </li>

     <li><span class="date">2008.05.13</span> - <p>A bug added to  <a name="openssl">OpenSSL</a> on <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">Debian</a> and <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2008-May/000705.html">Ubuntu</a> systems means that SSL keys on those systems may be guessable.</p>
<p>
We recommend that administrators using OpenSSL on Debian or Ubuntu
upgrade immediately.  We also recommend re-generating any SSL
certificates used in RADIUS systems, if those certificates were created on a Debian or Ubuntu system since 2006.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this is <em>not</em> a bug in FreeRADIUS.  FreeRADIUS uses OpenSSL for many of it's cryptographic operations, and as such, is at the mercy of any problems in OpenSSL.</p>
</li>
     <li><span class="date">2007.04.10</span> <a name="1.1.5">v1.1.5</a>, and earlier - A malicous 802.1x supplicant could send malformed Diameter format attributes inside of an EAP-TTLS tunnel.  The server would reject the authentication request, but would leak one <tt>VALUE_PAIR</tt> data structure, of approximately 300 bytes.  If an attacker performed the attack many times (e.g. thousands or more over a period of minutes to hours), the server could leak megabytes of memory, potentially leading to an "out of memory" condition, and early process exit.
<p>
We recommend that administrators using EAP-TTLS upgrade immediately.
</p>
<p>This bug was found as part of the <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> <a href="http://scan.coverity.com">Scan</a> project.</p>
</li>

     <li><span class="date">2006.03.20</span> <a name="1.0.5">v1.0.5</a>, and <a name="1.1.0">v1.1.0</a> - A validation issue exists with the EAP-MSCHAPv2 module in all versions from 1.0.0 (where the module first appeared) to 1.1.0.  Insufficient input validation was being done in the EAP-MSCHAPv2 state machine.  A malicious attacker could manipulate their EAP-MSCHAPv2 client state machine to potentially convince the server to bypass authentication checks.  This bypassing could also result in the server crashing.  We recommend that administrators upgrade immediately.</li>
 <br>

     <li><span class="date">2005.09.09</span> <a name="1.0.3">v1.0.3</a>, <a name="1.0.4">v1.0.4</a> - Multiple issues exist with version 1.0.4, and all prior versions of the server.  Externally exploitable vulnerabilities exist only for sites that use the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module.  Those sites may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, similar to the issues noted below.  All sites that have not deployed the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module are not vulnerable to external exploits.  However, we still recommend that all sites upgrade to version 1.0.5.
<p>
The issues are:
	<ul>
	<li> SQL Injection attack in the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module.</li>
        <li> Buffer overflow in the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module, that may cause a server crash.</li>
	<li> Buffer overflow while expanding %t, that may cause a server crash.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
These issues were found by Primoz Bratanic.  As the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module is marked "experimental" in the server source, it is not enabled or configured in most sites.  As a result, we believe that the number of vulnerable sites is low.
<p>
Additional issues, not externally exploitable, were found by Suse.  A full response to their report is available <a href="security/20050909-response-to-suse.txt">here</a>.  A related post to the <tt>vendor-sec</tt> mailing list is found <a href="security/20050909-vendor-sec.txt">here</a>.

     <li><span class="date">2005.05.01</span> <a name="1.0.1">v1.0.1</a>, <a name="1.0.2">v1.0.2</a> - Two vulnerabilities in the SQL module exist in all versions prior to 1.0.3.  Sites not using the SQL module are not affected by this issue.  However, we still recommend that all sites upgrade to version 1.0.3.
<p>
The issues are:
	<ul>
	<li> Buffer overflow - A long string could overflow an internal buffer in the SQL module, and write two bytes of text [0-9a-f] past the end of the buffer.  The server may exit when this happens, resulting in a DoS attack.  Depending on the local configuration of the server, this may occur before a user is authenticated.  This vulnerability is externally exploitable, but can not result in the execution of arbitrary code.
	</li>
	<li> SQL injection attacks - The SQL module suffers from SQL injection attacks in the <tt>group_membership_query</tt>, <tt>simul_count_query</tt>, and <tt>simul_verify_query</tt> configuration entries.  The first query is exploitable if your site is configured to use the <tt>SQL-Group</tt> attribute in any module in the <tt>authorize</tt> section of <tt>radiusd.conf</tt>.  The last two queries are exploitable only if your site has user names that contain a single quote character (<tt>'</tt>).

      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2004.09.14</span> <a name="1.0.0">v1.0.0</a> - Multiple external DoS attacks exist in the server.  These are related to the attacks below, in 0.9.2, but were not caught then.  The vulnerabilities are fixed in 1.0.1, and in all later versions of the server.  The vulnerabilities are not exploitable, but can be used to remotely crash the server.
      </li>
      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2003.11.20</span> <a name="0.9.3">v0.9.3</a> - There is an externally exploitable root compromise in rlm_smb,
through a stack overflow when a password greater than 128 bytes
referenced by the module.  The module is not built or installed by
default, so we have not released a 0.9.4.  This vulnerability is fixed
in the CVS snapshots, and will be included in any later release of the server.

      </li>

    </ul>

<h2>Non-Vulnerability Notifications</h2>

<p>Some "vulnerability" notifications issued for FreeRADIUS are, in
fact, non-issues.  These notifications are usually sent by the
originator to various security lists, without first notifying us.
This practice is problematic, because it does not give us the
opportunity to respond, or to correct the underlying problem before it
can be exploited.</p>

<p>We therefore recommend that anyone finding a potential issue with
FreeRADIUS contact us using the security contact information listed
above.  We will work with you to issue a coordinated statement about
the problem.</p>

<p>People who do not contact us, and who issue "vulnerabilities" that
are not real vulnerabilities get listed below.  This affords us the
opportunity to give an official response in a public forum.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="date">2010.10.01</span> <a
name="CVE-2010-3697"><a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3697">CVE-2010-3697</a></a> - This issue was filed without consulting with us, and we do not agree with the assessment.
<p>
The correct summary is that if the database is down for a long time
and the server is unresponsive, there are corner cases where known
clients (not attackers) sending large amounts of data can cause the
server to crash.
</p>
<p>
In normal operation, when the server stops responding to packets
(i.e. because the database is down), the NAS will stop sending it
packets, and will fail over to another server.  In addition, our tests
indicate that this issue occurs only when the database is down for
extended periods of time, and the server receives many millions of
packets during that time.  i.e. the problem will not occur in most
deployments.
</p>
<p>
We recommend that deployments monitor their database and RADIUS
server.  If the database is down for extended periods, the root cause
should be investigated and corrected.  When FreeRADIUS is configured
to depend on a database, database outages will naturally cause service
outages for the RADIUS server.  People who want a fix to this issue
can upgrade to the latest version of the server.
</p>
      </li>

      <li><span class="date">2010.10.01</span> <a
name="CVE-2010-3696"><a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3696">CVE-2010-3696</a></a> - This issue was filed without consulting with us, and we do not agree with the assessment.
<p>
The correct summary is that modifying the source code to the server
can cause it to crash.  The DHCP code is clearly marked
"experimental", and is not normally included in the server binaries.
It should be no surprise, therefore, that experimental and untested
features do not work properly.
</p>
<p>
We recommend that people run experimental code in a closed
environment.  People who want a fix to this issue can upgrade to the
latest version of the server.
</p>
      </li>

      <li><span class="date">2010.02.03</span> <a
name="CVE-2010-0524"><a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-0524">CVE-2010-0524</a></a> - This issue only affects Mac OS X Server systems.
<p>
Apple had apparently configured FreeRADIUS to accept all "well known"
Certificate Authorities as valid for EAP-TLS.  This configuration
permitted almost anyone to create a client certificate for use with
EAP-TLS, which would then be accepted by Mac OS X Server systems.
</p>
<p>
We recommend that the list of Certificate Authorities configured in
FreeRADIUS be audited, and kept as small as possible.
</p>

      <li><span class="date">2007.01.02</span> - <A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/455678/100/0/threaded">SMB_Handle_Type SMB_Connect_Server</A>.  While the summary is superficially correct, and there is a stack overflow in rlm_smb,  the issue is <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/455812/100/0/threaded">less problematic</a> than it sounds.
	    <p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2007-0080">CVE-2007-0080</a> has been updated with our statement.</p>

		<p><a href="http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/31248">freeradius-smbconnectserver-bo (31248)</a> has been updated to no longer claim the issue is remotely exploitable.  They do not, however, include our <a href="https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-devel/2007-January/010717.html">vendor statement</a>, though they do reference it.  They also list the issue as "High Risk", and "Gain Privileges", which is <em>NOT TRUE</em>, for the reasons outlined below.</p>
		    <p> In summary, the issue is <em>not remotely exploitable</em>.  It is exploitable by local administrators who have write access to the server configuration files.  If an attacker can write to the server configuration files, they can configure the server to run arbitrary programs.  Exploiting the server via a stack overflow would be unnecessary.</p>
	    	<p>The solution to this "vulnerability", of course, is to ensure that only the correct people are given write access to the server configuration files.</p>
