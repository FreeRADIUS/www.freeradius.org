<h1>Security Contact</h1>

<p>The FreeRADIUS security contact is <A
href="mailto:security@freeradius.org">security@freeradius.org</a>.
All security related information or notifications should be sent to
that address.  Security notifications may be signed with the pgp key
<a href="pgp/aland@freeradius.org">aland@freeradius.org</a>

<h2>Security of the RADIUS Protocol</h2>

The <a href="related/papers.html">security papers</a> page lists some
general issues with RADIUS security.</a>

<h2>Vulnerability Notifications</h2>

    <ul>
      <!--  
Scheme:  Make lines like 
LI, SPAN, "YYYY.MM.DD" comma /SPAN A "v.VERSION /A (CODENAME)" /LI
<li><span class="date">2003/01/30</span>v1.5 What went wrong...</li>
and put in reverse-chronological order.
       -->

     <li><span class="date">2006.03.20</span> <a name="1.0.5">v1.0.5</a>, and <a name="1.1.0">v1.1.0</a> - A validation issue exists with the EAP-MSCHAPv2 module in all versions from 1.0.0 (where the module first appeared) to 1.1.0.  Insufficient input validation was being done in the EAP-MSCHAPv2 state machine.  A malicious attacker could manipulate their EAP-MSCHAPv2 client state machine to potentially convince the server to bypass authentication checks.  This bypassing could also result in the server crashing.  We recommend that administrators upgrade immediately.</li>
 <br>

     <li><span class="date">2005.09.09</span> <a name="1.0.3">v1.0.3</a>, <a name="1.0.4">v1.0.4</a> - Multiple issues exist with version 1.0.4, and all prior versions of the server.  Externally exploitable vulnerabilities exist only for sites that use the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module.  Those sites may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, similar to the issues noted below.  All sites that have not deployed the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module are not vulnerable to external exploits.  However, we still recommend that all sites upgrade to version 1.0.5.
<p>
The issues are:
	<ul>
	<li> SQL Injection attack in the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module.</li>
        <li> Buffer overflow in the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module, that may cause a server crash.</li>
	<li> Buffer overflow while expanding %t, that may cause a server crash.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
These issues were found by Primoz Bratanic.  As the <tt>rlm_sqlcounter</tt> module is marked "experimental" in the server source, it is not enabled or configured in most sites.  As a result, we believe that the number of vulnerable sites is low.
<p>
Additional issues, not externally exploitable, were found by Suse.  A full response to their report is available <a href="security/20050909-response-to-suse.txt">here</a>.  A related post to the <tt>vendor-sec</tt> mailing list is found <a href="security/20050909-vendor-sec.txt">here</a>.
</li>

     <li><span class="date">2005.05.01</span> <a name="1.0.1">v1.0.1</a>, <a name="1.0.2">v1.0.2</a> - Two vulnerabilities in the SQL module exist in all versions prior to 1.0.3.  Sites not using the SQL module are not affected by this issue.  However, we still recommend that all sites upgrade to version 1.0.3.
<p>
The issues are:
	<ul>
	<li> Buffer overflow - A long string could overflow an internal buffer in the SQL module, and write two bytes of text [0-9a-f] past the end of the buffer.  The server may exit when this happens, resulting in a DoS attack.  Depending on the local configuration of the server, this may occur before a user is authenticated.  This vulnerability is externally exploitable, but can not result in the execution of arbitrary code.
	</li>
	<li> SQL injection attacks - The SQL module suffers from SQL injection attacks in the <tt>group_membership_query</tt>, <tt>simul_count_query</tt>, and <tt>simul_verify_query</tt> configuration entries.  The first query is exploitable if your site is configured to use the <tt>SQL-Group</tt> attribute in any module in the <tt>authorize</tt> section of <tt>radiusd.conf</tt>.  The last two queries are exploitable only if your site has user names that contain a single quote character (<tt>'</tt>).
	</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2004.09.14</span> <a name="1.0.0">v1.0.0</a> - Multiple external DoS attacks exist in the server.  These are related to the attacks below, in 0.9.2, but were not caught then.  The vulnerabilities are fixed in 1.0.1, and in all later versions of the server.  The vulnerabilities are not exploitable, but can be used to remotely crash the server.
      </li>
      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2003.11.20</span> <a name="0.9.3">v0.9.3</a> - There is an externally exploitable root compromise in rlm_smb,
through a stack overflow when a password greater than 128 bytes
referenced by the module.  The module is not built or installed by
default, so we have not released a 0.9.4.  This vulnerability is fixed
in the CVS snapshots, and will be included in any later release of the server.
      </li>
      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2003.10.15</span> <a
name="0.9.2">v0.9.2</a> - Anyone who can send packets to the server
can crash it by sending a Tunnel-Password attribute in an
Access-Request packet.  This vulnerability is not otherwise
exploitable.  We have released 0.9.3 to correct this vulnerability.
      </li>
      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2002.07.26</span> <a name="0.7.0">v0.7.0</a> - The Kerberos module may grant access to a user whose Kerberos ticket cannot be verified against the server principal.  We have released 0.7.1 to correct this vulnerability.
      </li>
      <p>

      <li><span class="date">2001.12.17</span> <a name="0.3">v0.3</a> - <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-06.html">CA-2002-06</A>.  Multiple vulnerabilities in multiple RADIUS implementations.  We have released 0.4 to correct these vulnerabilities.
      </li>

    </ul>

<h2>Non-Vulnerability Notifications</h2>

<p>Some "vulnerability" notifications issued for FreeRADIUS are, in
fact, non-issues.  These notifications are usually sent by the
originator to various security lists, without first notifying us.
This practice is problematic, because it does not give us the
opportunity to respond, or to correct the underlying problem before it
can be exploited.</p>

<p>We therefore recommend that anyone finding a potential issue with
FreeRADIUS contact us using the security contact information listed
above.  We will work with you to issue a coordinated statement about
the problem.</p>

<p>People who do not contact us, and who issue "vulnerabilities" that
are not real vulnerabilities get listed below.  This affords us the
opportunity to give an official response in a public forum.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="date">2007.01.02</span> - <A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/455678/100/0/threaded">SMB_Handle_Type SMB_Connect_Server</A>.  While the summary is superficially correct, and there is a stack overflow in rlm_smb,  the issue is <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/455812/100/0/threaded">less problematic</a> than it sounds.
	    <p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2007-0080">CVE-2007-0080</a> has been updated with our statement.</p>
	    <p><a href="http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2007/Jan/1017463.html">SecurityTracker Alert ID:  1017463</a> has been updated with our statement.</p>
		<p><a href="http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/31248">freeradius-smbconnectserver-bo (31248)</a> has been updated to no longer claim the issue is remotely exploitable.  They do not, however, include our <a href="https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-devel/2007-January/010717.html">vendor statement</a>, though they do reference it.  They also list the issue as "High Risk", and "Gain Privileges", which is <em>NOT TRUE</em>, for the reasons outlined below.</p>
		    <p> In summary, the issue is <em>not remotely exploitable</em>.  It is exploitable by local administrators who have write access to the server configuration files.  If an attacker can write to the server configuration files, they can configure the server to run arbitrary programs.  Exploiting the server via a stack overflow would be unnecessary.</p>
	    	<p>The solution to this "vulnerability", of course, is to ensure that only the correct people are given write access to the server configuration files.</p>
