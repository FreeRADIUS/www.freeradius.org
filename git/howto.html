<h1>A Short git "howto"</h1>

<p>Using git is a little different than other version control systems.
The simplest explanation is that you use branches in git.  A lot.
Always.  For everything.</p>

<p>Did we mention the branches?</p>

<p>In practice, this means your normal git operation is a little more
complex than CVS or SVN work flows.  With CVS and SVN, you do a
checkout, edit the local source tree, and then do <tt>cvs diff</tt>
against the central repository to see what changed.</p>

<p>With git, there is <em>no</em> central repository.  There is only
your local checkout.  If you edit the local checkout, then you have no
idea what the differences are between the central repository and your
changes.  Even worse, if you pull updates from the central repository,
any local changes are lost.</p>

<p>The solution is the following work flow:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git clone https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server.git radiusd
$ cd radiusd
$ git checkout -b local
</pre>

<p>The second line creates the branch <em>local</em>, and checks it
out.  You can then edit, commit, and do <em>diff</em>, pretty much
like with CVS:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git status
	<em>Prints out files that have changed</em>
$ git diff <em>files</em>
$ git commit <em>files</em>
</pre>

<p>All of your changes will go to the local branch.  This practice
lets you track the changes between it and the master branch:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git diff master
</pre>

<p>You can periodically pull updates from the central repository:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git pull origin master:master
</pre>

<p>This command pulls the changes from the central
repository <em>and</em> merges those changes into your local branch.
Any conflicts can be fixed with a bit of work:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git mergetool
	<em>You probably want kdiff3 here</em>
$ git commit -i <em>conflicted-files</em>
</pre>

<h3>Committing changes back to the central repository</h3>

<p>The process of committing changes back to the central repository is
more complicated than with CVS.  Most of the complexity is due to the
fact that the work is on a local branch, and not on the master branch.
The changes have to be pushed first to the copy of the master branch,
and then from there to the central repository.</p>

<p>Check that your local copy is up to date:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git pull origin master:master
</pre>

<p>Switch to the master branch, and merge the changes from your local
branch:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git checkout master
$ git merge <em>local</em>
</pre>

<p>This is pretty much the <em>only</em> time you should commit
directly to the master branch.<p>

<p>Check that your commits are there:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git log | more
</pre>

<p>And push the changes back to the central repository:</p>

<pre class="config">
$ git push
</pre>

<p>More complex workflows are possible, of course.  This document is
intended to be just a short introduction for people moving from
CVS.</p>
