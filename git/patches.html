<h1>Submitting Patches</h1>

<p>The guiding principal is typically expressed as "one change per
patch; one patch per change".  That is, the fundamental property of
interest is not size, but the number of logically separate changes
which are part of the same patch.  The correct number is always
exactly one.<p>

<p>Multiple related edits like changing a function's prototype, making
the corresponding change to its definition, and updating all of the
call sites are really a single change, and should be part of the same
patch, and thus the same commit.<p>

<p>The same goes for a group of edits spread across the tree that
introduce a new feature or fix a bug.  If they're part of one logical
change, they should be part of one commit.  A good rule to use here is
to combine things that are syntactically or semantically
interdependent, such that applying only part of the change results in
a tree that doesn't build or that no longer works correctly.<p>

<p>The flip side is that unrelated things should generally not be part
of the same patch.  Don't fix a bug and add a feature in the same
patch.  Or fix two bugs, or add two features.  That goes triple for
keeping cosmetic/stylistic changes such as a reindent separate from
warning elimination, and both separate from actual functional changes.
Similarly, any new code should follow the same formatting conventions
as the existing code, for indentation, location of braces, etc.</p>

<p>Putting unrelated changes in the same patch makes that patch harder to
review, makes it harder to accept one change but not the other (which
may result in the whole thing being rejected), and makes it harder to
track down what happened if one of those changes introduced a bug.
"git bisect" is a powerful tool for tracking down when a problem was
introduced, but can't split the difference between two changes that
were part of the same commit.</p>

<p>It is often be possible to take a large set of changes to add a
complex new feature, and break it down into smaller parts, each
building on the last.  Such things are often easier to review and
test, which is always a good thing.</p>

<p>The
patch <a href="http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications">guide
on github</a> has good instructions for submitting changes.  If the
patch is small, it can be submitted to the list.  See the
file <a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/master/doc/DIFFS.rst">doc/DIFFS.rst</a>
for additional instructions.</p>
