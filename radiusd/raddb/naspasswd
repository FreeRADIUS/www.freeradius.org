#
# naspasswd	This is the file that primarily stores the passwords
#		for the NASes.  This will be read by checkrad.pl to
#		supply the password for a certain NAS if needed, in the
#		event that FreeRADIUS server suspects a multiple login.
#
#		Note that at this time you ONLY need to enter passwords
#		here if you use a non-SNMP method to poll the terminal
#		servers, eg ONLY with USR/3Com Total Control, NetServer 
#		and Cyclades PathRAS servers!
#
#		This is in the format:
#
#			ip_address<SPACE>login_name<SPACE>password
#
#		Blank lines and lines with '#' as the first
#		character are ignored.
#
# WARNING: 	Always make sure that this file has the "-r------" permission.
#		And, don't set the passwords on your other systems to the same
#		passwords that can be found below.
