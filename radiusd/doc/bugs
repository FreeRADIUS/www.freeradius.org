BUGS

0.INTRODUCTION

  The FreeRADIUS web site is at <URL: http://www.freeradius.org>, and
  most information referenced in this document can be found there.

  This is primarily for non-developers of the FreeRADIUS server. If you are
  able to patch the code to work correctly, then we invite you to join the
  development list to discuss it. If you're the type who know little about
  how to code, then this is the place for you!

1.YOU FOUND A BUG

  So you think you've found a bug in the FreeRADIUS server?

  You should first discuss it on the users list, to see if anyone can
  reproduce it. Often there's a simple explanation of why the server
  behaves as it does, and it's not necessarily a bug in the code, so
  browse the lists' archives of the last two months, and if you don't
  see messages about it, ask!

  If the behavior is correct but confusing, we think that's a bug too, and
  you should file a bug against our documentation.

  For more information about the users list, the lists' archives and the
  faq, please visit http://www.freeradius.org/list/users.html
  Please make sure to READ and RESPECT the house-rules. You will get much
  better response and much faster if you do!

2.CORE DUMPS

  If the server, or one of the accompyaning programs core dumps, then
  you should rebuild the server as follows:

  $ ./configure --enable-developer
  $ make
  $ make install

  and then run the program again. You may have to to enable core
  dumps, via:

  $ ulimit -c unlimited

  When it core dumps, do:

  $ gdb /path/to/executable /path/to/core/file

  Enable logging in gdb via the following commands:

  (gdb) set logging file gdb-radiusd.log
  (gdb) set logging on

  and follow the instructions in section 4, below.

3. DEBUGGING A LIVE SERVER

  If you can't get a core dump, or the problem doesn't result in a
  core dump, you may have to run the server under gdb.  To do this,
  ensure that you have symbols in the binaries (i.e. a non-stripped
  binary) by re-building the server as described in the previous
  section.  Then, run the server under gdb as follows:

  $ gdb radiusd

  Enable logging in gdb via the following commands:

  (gdb) set logging file gdb-radiusd.log
  (gdb) set logging on

  Tell gdb to pass any necessary command-line arguments to the
  server:

  (gdb) set args ...

  Where the "..." are the command-line arguments you normally pass to
  radiusd.  If you don't normally pass command-line arguments, this
  line is not necessary.

  Then, do:

  (gdb) run

  When something interesting happens, you can hit CTRL-C in the
  window, and you should be back at the gdb prompt:

  (gdb)

  And follow the instructions in section 4, below.

4. OBTAINING USEFUL INFORMATION

  If the server was built with threads, you can do:

  (gdb) info threads

  Which will give you information about the threads.  If the server
  isn't threaded, that command-line will print a message saying so.

  Then, do:

  (gdb) thread apply all bt full

  If the server isn't threaded, the "thread apply" section isn't necessary

  The output should be printed to the screen, and also sent to the
  gdb-radiusd.log file.  Copy the log gile and mail it to the list, or
  put it on a web page if it's too large.  Include the name of the
  operating system.
  Without this information, it's impossible for anyone to know why the
  program core dumped.

  You can also submit the information to the bug database at:

    http://bugs.freeradius.org/

  Submitting it to the bug database ensures that the bug report won't
  get forgotten, and that someone will eventually respond to it.
