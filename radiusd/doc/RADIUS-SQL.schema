RADIUS-SQL.schema

0.INTRODUCTION

  In order for your radius server to query an sql database, you must
  have a database schema on which the radius server can perform queries.
  The server ships with default database schema's for which the default
  queries are constructed.

1.DATABASE SCHEMA
 
  There isn't a generic SQL schema, but there is one for some databases:

    src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_mysql/db_mysql.sql
    src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_postgresql/db_postgresql.sql
    src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_freetds/db_mssql.sql
    src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_oracle/db_oracle.sql
