Welcome to the new SQL Based IP Pool module.

To use the sqlipool module you simply need to have an IP-Pool Attribute
(Keep in mind that its a **CHECK** item, not reply) in the required
configuration file, which is either in files(users),sql or any other
type of configuration schema.

The initialization of the radippool table is left to the user instead of
being handled inside the module. This allows pool management to be done
from any sql capable programming language and pools can be created,
resized, deleted at run time without radiusd needing to be restarted.

The only required fields are, pool_name and ip_address. A pool consists
of one or more rows in the table with the same pool_name and a different
ip_address. The is no restriction on which ip addresses/ranges may be in
the same pool, and addresses do not need to be concurrent.

We are currently using the variable definitions of the xlat module, so
before editing the sqlippool.conf file, please go and read the
variables.txt in the freeradius/doc directory. It will help you alot!..

On the other hand, there is a "key", which is really the key for the
pool modules in freeradius. As you may noticed, there is a pool-key
variable on the config file to have a unique connection identifier for
the requests.So, it should be set to the unique attribute of the
packages that we are receiving. Also this unique identifier must be
received in accounting-stop packages so that we release the used ip,
from the pool and put it to the free-ips list.
