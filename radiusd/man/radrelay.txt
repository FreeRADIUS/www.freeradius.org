RADRELAY(8)		       FreeRADIUS Daemon		   RADRELAY(8)



NAME
       radrelay -- replicate accounting data to another RADIUS server

SYNOPSIS
       radrelay  [-a  accounting_dir]  [-d radius_dir] [-f] [-i source_ip] [-n
       shortname] [-r remote-server[:port]] [-s secret] [-S secret_file]  [-x]
       detailfile

DESCRIPTION
       Radrelay  reads	a  file in the detail file format, reconstructs radius
       packets from it and sends them to a remote radius server. When  end-of-
       file  is reached, the file is truncated.  Radrelay then waits for addi-
       tional data to be written to the file, and starts over again.



OPTIONS
       -a accounting_directory
	      The base directory to use to read the detail file from.


       -d radius_directory
	      The base radius (raddb) directory, where the config files  live.


       -f     Do not fork and run in the background as a daemon.


       -i source_ip
	      The source IP address to use for sending radius packets.


       -n shortname
	      The  radius  configuration  files  (most probably clients.conf),
	      will be searched for a client section with  'shortname'  set  to
	      the used argument.  Both the server secret and the remote-server
	      address are obtained in this way. Do not use the -r,  -s	or  -S
	      parameters in combination with -n.


       -r remote-server
	      The  hostname  or  IP address of the remote server. Optionally a
	      UDP port can be specified. If no UDP port is  specified,	it  is
	      looked  up  in  /etc/services.  The  service  name looked for is
	      radacct for accounting packets. If a service  is	not  found  in
	      /etc/services,  1813  is used. The -r parameter can't be used in
	      combination with -n.


       -s secret
	      Remote server secret.


       -S secret_file
	      Read remote server secret from file,  the  file  should  contain
	      nothing other then the plain-text secret.


       -x     Enable debug mode, -x will activate radrelay internal debugging,
	      -xx will also activate librad debugging.


       detailfile
	      The detail file to use,  this  will  be  appended  to  the  base
	      accounting directory.
