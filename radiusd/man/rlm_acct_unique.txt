rlm_acct_unique(5)	       FreeRADIUS Module	    rlm_acct_unique(5)



NAME
       rlm_acct_unique - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The rlm_acct_unique module creates a unique accounting session Id.

       Many  NAS  vendors  have  their	equipment  supply  an  Acct-Session-Id
       attribute which is not unique over reboots.  This makes accounting dif-
       ficult,	as there will be many independent sessions with the same Acct-
       Session-Id attribute.  This module uses the Acct-Session-Id  attribute,
       along  with  other  attributes  in the request, to create a more unique
       session ID, called Acct-Unique-Session-Id.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       key    A list of the attributes used in calculating an MD5  hash  which
	      is used as the value for the unique session id.

CONFIGURATION
	      modules {
		...
		acct_unique {
		   key = "User-Name, Acct-Session-Id, NAS-IP-Address, NAS-Port"
		}
		...
	      }
	       ...
	      preacct {
		...
		acct_unique
		...
	      }


       After  generating  the  MD5  hash, the module adds it to the accounting
       request packet received from the client.  It will look  something  like
       this in your detail file:


		   Acct-Unique-Session-Id = "c66ef57e480b9d26"


       NOTE:   Any attribute you specify that is not found in the 'dictionary'
       file will cause the server to fail and exit with an error.

       NOTE:  If you want the Acct-Unique-Session-Id of the Start and the Stop
       packet  of  a  particular session to match, you must use values for the
       key that will stay the same for the Start and Stop.  The above  example
       is  a good start.  Adding 'Acct-Session-Time', for example, would cause
       a mismatch because that value is not the same on  the  Start  and  Stop
       accounting packets.
