NAME
       clients - RADIUS clients file

DESCRIPTION
       The  clients  file resides in the radius database directory, by default
       /etc/raddb. Its use is depreciated in favour of clients.conf.

       Every line starting with a hash sign ('#') is treated  as  comment  and
       ignored.

       Each line of the file contains two white-space delimited fields.

       client hostname
	      The RADIUS clients hostname.  This may be a plain hostname, or a
	      dotted-quad IP address.

       secret This is the so-called "shared secret" that  is  held  between  a
	      RADIUS  server  and  client.  It is used to encrypt passwords in
	      RADIUS packets, and also for authentication. You need to config-
	      ure  the	same secret on the client (terminal server) as in this
	      file.

       The clients file is read by radiusd on startup only.

FILES
