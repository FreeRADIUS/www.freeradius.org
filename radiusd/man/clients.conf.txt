clients.conf(5) 	FreeRADIUS client configuration        clients.conf(5)



NAME
       clients.conf - FreeRADIUS client configuration

DESCRIPTION
       The clients.conf file contains definitions of RADIUS clients.

       The  information in this file overrides any information provided in the
       deprecated clients(5) and naslist(5) files.

       The file format is  the	same  as  that	used  for  radiusd.conf.   See
       radiusd.conf(5) for more details.

       Each RADIUS client entry has the following basic form:

	      client <hostname|ip-address|ip-network> {
		     <attribute> = <value>
	       }

       ip-network is used to specify a network of clients. Networks are speci-
       fied in CIDR notation. If multiple overlapping  networks  are  defined,
       the best match (smallest possible network) will be chosen for a packet.

ATTRIBUTES
       The attributes that can appear in a client section  are	listed	below.
       Required  attributes  are  labelled  as	such. All other attributes are
       optional.


       secret [Required]
	    The RADIUS	shared	secret	used  for  communication  between  the
	    client/NAS and the RADIUS server.

       shortname [Required]
	    A short alias that can be used in place of the IP address or fully
	    qualified hostname provided in the first line of the section.

       nastype
	    The nastype attribute is used to tell the checkrad.pl script which
	    NAS-specific  method it should use when checking simultaneous use.

	    The following values are currently recognized:
	    cisco
	    computone
	    livingston
	    max40xx
	    multitech
	    netserver
	    pathras
	    patton
	    portslave
	    tc
	    usrhiper
	    other

       login
	    Reserved for future use.

       password
	    Reserved for future use.

EXAMPLES
	      client 127.0.0.1 {
		      secret	      = testing123
		      shortname       = localhost
		      nastype	      = other
	      }

       This adds a client for the loopback address. This is useful in  testing
       the server locally, for example with radclient(1).

	      client 192.168.0.0/24 {
		     secret	     = testing123-1
		     shortname	     = private-network-1
	      }

       This entry represents any client from the 192.168.0.0/24 network.
