clients.conf(5) 	FreeRADIUS client configuration        clients.conf(5)



NAME
       clients.conf - FreeRADIUS client configuration

DESCRIPTION
       The clients.conf file contains definitions of RADIUS clients.

       The  information in this file overrides any information provided in the
       deprecated clients and naslist files.

       The file format is  the	same  as  that	used  for  radiusd.conf.   See
       radiusd.conf(5) for more details.

       Each RADIUS client entry has the following basic form:

	      client <short-name> {
		     <attribute> = <value>
	       }

       Clients	have many configuration parameters. Most are documented in the
       file itself as comments. This page documents only  the  format  of  the
       file. Please read the clients.conf file itself for more information.

       The old-style format from 1.x is still accepted by the server, but that
       form is deprecated.
