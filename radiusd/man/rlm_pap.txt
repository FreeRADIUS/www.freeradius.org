rlm_pap(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		    rlm_pap(5)



NAME
       rlm_pap - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_pap  module  authenticates  RADIUS Access-Request packets that
       contain a User-Password attribute.  The module should  also  be	listed
       last  in  the  authorize  section,  so  that  it  can set the Auth-Type
       attribute as appropriate.

       When a RADIUS packet contains a clear-text password in the  form  of  a
       User-Password attribute, the rlm_pap module may be used for authentica-
       tion.  The module requires a "known good" password, which  it  uses  to
       validate  the  password	given in the RADIUS packet.  That "known good"
       password must be supplied by another module (e.g. rlm_files,  rlm_ldap,
       etc.), and is usually taken from a database.

CONFIGURATION
       The only configuration item is:

       normalise
	      The  default  is	"yes".	This means that the module will try to
	      automatically detect passwords that are hex-  or	base64-encoded
	      and  decode  them back to their binary representation.  However,
	      some clear text passwords may be erroneously converted.  Setting
	      this to "no" prevents that conversion.

USAGE
       The module looks for the Password-With-Header control attribute to find
       the "known good" password. The attribute  value	comprises  the	header
       followed  immediately  by the password data. The header is given by the
       following table.

       Header	    Attribute		Description
       ------	    ---------		-----------
       {clear}	    Cleartext-Password	clear-text passwords
       {cleartext}  Cleartext-Password	clear-text passwords
       {crypt}	    Crypt-Password	Unix-style "crypt"ed passwords
       {md5}	    MD5-Password	MD5 hashed passwords
       {base64_md5} MD5-Password	MD5 hashed passwords
       {smd5}	    SMD5-Password	MD5 hashed passwords, with a salt
       {sha}	    SHA-Password	SHA1 hashed passwords
		    SHA1-Password	SHA1 hashed passwords
       {ssha}	    SSHA-Password	SHA1 hashed passwords, with a salt
		    SSHA1-Password	SHA1 hashed passwords, with a salt
       {ssh2}	    SHA2-Password	SHA2 hashed passwords
       {ssh256}     SHA2-Password	SHA2 hashed passwords
       {ssh512}     SHA2-Password	SHA2 hashed passwords
       {nt}	    NT-Password 	Windows NT hashed passwords
       {nthash}     NT-Password 	Windows NT hashed passwords
       {x-nthash}   NT-Password 	Windows NT hashed passwords
       {ns-mta-md5} NS-MTA-MD5-Password Netscape MTA MD5 hashed passwords
       {x- orcllmv} LM-Password 	Windows LANMAN hashed passwords
       {X- orclntv} LM-Password 	Windows LANMAN hashed passwords

       The module tries to be flexible when handling the various password for-
       mats.   It will automatically handle Base-64 encoded data, hex strings,
       and binary data, and convert them to a format that the server can use.

       If there is no Password-With-Header attribute, the module looks for one
       of the Cleartext-Password, NT-Password, Crypt-Password, etc. attributes
       as listed in the above table. These attributes should contain the rele-
       vant format password directly, without the header prefix.

       Only  one control attribute should be set, otherwise behaviour is unde-
       fined as to which one is used for authentication.

NOTES
       It is important to understand the difference between the  User-Password
       and Cleartext-Password attributes.  The Cleartext-Password attribute is
       the "known good" password for the user.	Simply supplying  the  Cleart-
       ext-Password  to  the server will result in most authentication methods
       working.  The User-Password attribute is the password as  typed	in  by
       the  user  on  their  private  machine.	 The two are not the same, and
       should be treated very differently.  That is, you should generally  not
       use the User-Password attribute anywhere in the RADIUS configuration.
