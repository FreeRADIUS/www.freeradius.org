NAME
       radwatch - wrapper for radiusd

SYNOPSIS
       radwatch [options]

       This  is a wrapper for radiusd. It starts the radius server, then waits
       for it to terminate, which should never happen. If it does happen, rad-
       watch sends a notification email to root about the event, waits 10 sec-
       onds, then restarts the server.

       This script SHOULD NOT BE USED!	It's only  here  for  historical  pur-
       poses, and WILL be deleted in a future version of the the server.

       Please see 'doc/supervise-radiusd.txt' for info on methods of supervis-
       ing your radius installation.
