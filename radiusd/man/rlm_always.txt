rlm_always(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		 rlm_always(5)



NAME
       rlm_always - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_always module provides a simple way to "always" return a value
       during the processing of a configuration section.

       The main configuration item is rcode, which sets the return  code  that
       this  instantiation  of	the  module  will return. The default, if none
       specified, is 'fail'.

       The valid options for rcode are as follows:

	      reject reject the user;

	      fail   a failure has occurred;

	      ok     success;

	      handled
		     the  request  has	been  handled:	processing  should  be
		     stopped and the response sent;

	      invalid
		     request is invalid;

	      userlock
		     the user account has been locked out;

	      notfound
		     the user account cannot be found;

	      noop   no-op: nothing has happened;

	      updated
		     the request has been updated.

CONFIGURATION
       rcode = <code>
	      This  module  will  always  return  with	the code specified, as
	      listed in the table  above.   If	unspecified,  the  default  is
	      'fail'.

       simulcount = <n>
	      If  this module is used in the session{} section, the simulcount
	      option simulates the  user  having  'n'  current	sessions.  The
	      default is to not override the number of sessions.

       mpp = <yes|no>
	      If set to yes, and this module is used in the session{} section,
	      this simulates the user having multilink sessions.  The  default
	      is 'no'.


EXAMPLE
	      modules {
		...
		# instantiate the "always" module with the name "ok"
		always ok {
		   # return code for this instantiation is "ok":
		   rcode = ok
		}
		...
	      }

	      authorize {
		...
		redundant {
		   sql1 	 # try to find the user in sql1
		   sql2 	 # try to find the user in sql2
		   # the default here would be to fail, but...
		   ok		 # if still not found, it's OK.
		}
		...
	      }
