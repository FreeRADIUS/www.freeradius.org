NAME
       naslist - RADIUS naslist file

DESCRIPTION
       The  naslist  file resides in the radius database directory, by default
       /etc/raddb. It  contains  a  list  of  RADIUS  network  access  servers
       (NASes).  Every line starting with a hash sign ('#') is treated as com-
       ment and ignored.

       Each line of the file contains three white-space delimited fields.

       client hostname
	      The NAS hostname. This may be a plain hostname, or a dotted-quad
	      IP address.

       shortname
	      This  field is optional, and declares a short alias for the NAS.

       NAStype
	      Type of NAS (terminalserver). This  can  be  livingston,	cisco,
	      portslave  or  other.  This is passed to the external checklogin
	      program when it is called to detect double logins.

       The naslist file is read by radiusd on startup only.
