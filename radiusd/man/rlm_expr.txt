NAME
       rlm_expr - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_expr  module allows the server to perform limited mathematical
       calculations.  This module is not called directly in any section, it is
       invoked through the dynamic expansion of strings.

       For example, some NAS boxes send a NAS-Port attribute which is a 32-bit
       number composed of port, card, and interface, all in  different	bytes.
       To see these attributes split into pieces, you can have an entry in the
       'users' file like:


	      DEFAULT
		  Vendor-Interface = `%{expr: %{NAS-Port} / (256 * 256)}`,
		  Vendor-Card = `%{expr: (%{NAS-Port} / 256) %% 256}`,
		  Vendor-Port = `%{expr: %{NAS-Port} %% 256}`


       where the attributes Vendor-Interface, Vendor-Card, and Vendor-Port are
       attributes created by either you or a vendor-supplied dictionary.

       The methematical operators supported by the expression module are:

       +      addition

       -      subtraction

       /      division

       %%     modulo remainder

       *      multiplication

       &      boolean AND

       |      boolean OR

       ()     grouping of sub-expressions

       NOTE:  The modulo remainder operator is '%%', and not '%'.  This is due
       to the '%' character being used as  a  special  character  for  dynamic
       translation.

       NOTE: These operators do NOT have precedence.  The parsing of the input
       string, and the calculation of the answer, is  done  strictly  left  to
       right.	If you wish to order the expressions, you MUST group them into
       sub-expression, as shown in the previous example.

       All of the calculations are performed as unsigned 32-bit integers.
