NAME
       dictionary - RADIUS dictionary file

DESCRIPTION
       The  dictionary	file  resides  in  the	radius	database directory, by
       default /etc/raddb. It contains a list of RADIUS attributes and values,
       which  the server uses to map between descriptive names and on-the-wire
       data.  The names have no meaning outside of the RADIUS  server  itself,
       and are never exchanged between server and clients.

       Every  line  starting  with a hash sign ('#') is treated as comment and
       ignored.

       Each line of the file can contain one of the following strings

       ATTRIBUTE name number type [vendor|options]
	    Define a RADIUS attribute name to number mapping.  The name  field
	    can  be any non-space text, but is usually taken from RFC2865, and
	    other related documents.  The number field is also taken from  the
	    relevant  documents,  for that name.  The type field can be one of
	    string, octets, ipaddr, integer, date, ifid, ipv6addr, ipv6prefix,
	    or	abinary.   See	the  RFC's,  or the main dictionary file for a
	    description of the various types.

	    The last (optional) field of  an  attribute  definition  can  have
	    either  a vendor name, or options for that attribute.  When a ven-
	    dor name is given, the attribute is defined to be  a  vendor  spe-
	    cific attribute.  Alternately, the options may be the a comma-sep-
	    arated list of the following options:


	    encrypt=[1-3]
	    Mark the attribute as being encrypted with one of  three  methods.
	    "1"  means	that  the  attribute  is  encrypted with the method as
	    defined in RFC2865 for the	User-Password  attribute.   "2"  means
	    that  the  password  is  encrypted	with  the method as defined in
	    RFC2868 for the Tunnel-Password attribute.	 "3"  means  that  the
	    attribute is encrypted as per Ascend's definitions for the Ascend-
	    Send-Secret attribute.

	    has_tag
	    Mark the attribute as being permitted to have a tag, as defined in
	    RFC2868.   The  purpose  of  the  tag  is  to  allow  grouping  of
	    attributes for tunnelled users.  See RFC2868 for more details.

       When the server receives an encoded attribute in a  RADIUS  packet,  it
       looks  up that attribute by number in the dictionary, and uses the name
       found there for printing diagnostic and log messages.


       VALUE attribute-name value-name number
	    Define an attribute value name to number mapping, for an attribute
	    of	type  integer.	 The  attribute-name  field MUST be previously
	    defined by an ATTRIBUTE entry.  The value-name field  can  be  any
	    non-space  text, but is usually taken from RFC2865, or other docu-
	    ments..  The number field is also taken from  the  relevant  docu-
	    ments, for that name.

	    When  the  server receives an encoded value in a RADIUS packet, it
	    looks up the value of that attribute by number in the  dictionary,
	    and uses the name found there for printing diagnostic and log mes-
	    sages.


       VENDOR vendor-name number
	    Define a Vendor Specific Attribute encapsulation  for  vendor-name
	    to	 number.   For	a  list  of  vendor  names  and  numbers,  see
	    http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt.


       $INCLUDE filename
	    Include dictionary entries from the file filename.	 The  filename
	    is	taken  as relative to the location of the file which is asking
	    for the inclusion.
