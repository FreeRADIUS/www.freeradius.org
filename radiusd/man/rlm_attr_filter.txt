       The  _r_l_m___a_t_t_r___f_i_l_t_e_r module exists for filtering certain attributes and
       values in received ( or transmitted ) radius packets from  (  or  to  )
       remote proxy servers.  It gives the proxier ( us ) a flexible framework
       to filter the attributes we send to or receive from these remote  prox‐
       ies.  This makes sense, for example, in an out-sourced dialup situation
       to various policy decisions, such as restricting a  client  to  certain
       ranges of Idle-Timeout or Session-Timeout.

       Filter  rules  are  defined and applied on a per-realm basis, where the
       realm is anything that is defined and matched based on  the  configura‐
       tion of the _r_l_m___r_e_a_l_m module.

       The  file  that defines the attribute filtering rules follows a similar
       syntax to the _u_s_e_r_s file.  There are a few differences however:

           There are no check-items allowed other than the realm.

           There can only be a single DEFAULT entry.

       The rules for each entry are parsed to top to bottom, and an  attribute
       must  pass *all* the rules which affect it in order to make it past the
       filter.  Order of the rules is important.  The operators and their pur‐
       pose in defining the rules are as follows:

       ==      THIS  OPERATOR  IS NOT ALLOWED.  If used, and warning message is
              printed and it is treated as ==

       ::==     Set, this attribute and value will always be placed in the  out‐
              put A/V Pairs.  If the attribute exists, it is overwritten.

       ====     Equal, value must match exactly.

       ==**     Always Equal, allow all values for the specified attribute.

       !!**     Never Equal, disallow all values for the specified attribute.  (
              This is redundant, as any A/V Pair not explicitly permitted will
              be dropped ).

       !!==     Not Equal, value must not match.

       >>==     Greater Than or Equal

       <<==     Less Than or Equal

       >>      Greather Than

       <<      Less Than

       If  regular  expressions  are  enabled the following operators are also
       possible.  ( Regular Expressions are included by  default  unless  your
       system  doesn’t  support them, which should be rare ).  The value field
       uses standard regular expression syntax.


       ==~~     Regular Expression Equal

       !!~~     Regular Expression Not Equal

       See the default _/_e_t_c_/_r_a_d_d_b_/_a_t_t_r_s for working examples  of  sample  rule
       ordering and how to use the different operators.

       The main configuration item is:

       attrsfile
              This  specifies the location of the file used to load the filter
              rules.
