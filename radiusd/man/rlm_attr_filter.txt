rlm_attr_filter(5)	       FreeRADIUS Module	    rlm_attr_filter(5)



NAME
       rlm_attr_filter - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_attr_filter module exists for filtering certain attributes and
       values in received ( or transmitted ) radius  packets.	It  gives  the
       server  a  flexible  framework  to  filter the attributes we send to or
       receive from home servers or NASes.  This makes sense, for example,  in
       an  out-sourced	dialup	situation to various policy decisions, such as
       restricting a client to certain ranges of Idle-Timeout or Session-Time-
       out.

       Filter  rules  are  normally  defined and applied on a per-realm basis,
       where the realm is anything that is defined and matched	based  on  the
       configuration  of the rlm_realm module.	Filter rules can optionally be
       applied using another attribute, by editing the key  configuration  for
       this module.

       In  2.0.1  and  earlier versions, the "accounting" section filtered the
       Accounting-Request, even though it  was	documented  as	filtering  the
       response.   This  issue	has been fixed in version 2.0.2 and later ver-
       sions.  The "preacct" section may now be  used  to  filter  Accounting-
       Request	packets.   The	"accounting"  section  now filters Accounting-
       Response packets.  Administrators using "attr_filter" in the  "account-
       ing"  section SHOULD move the reference to "attr_filter" from "account-
       ing" to "preacct".

       The file that defines the attribute filtering rules follows  a  similar
       syntax to the users file.  There are a few differences however:


		  There are no check-items allowed other than the name of the key.

		  There can only be a single DEFAULT entry.

	      The rules for each entry are parsed to top to bottom, and an
	      attribute must pass *all* the rules which affect it in order to
	      make it past the filter.	Order of the rules is important.
	      The operators and their purpose in defining the rules are as
	      follows:

	      =      THIS OPERATOR IS NOT ALLOWED.  If used, and warning message is
		     printed and it is treated as ==

	      :=     Set, this attribute and value will always be placed in the
		     output A/V Pairs.	If the attribute exists, it is overwritten.

	      ==     Equal, value must match exactly.

	      =*     Always Equal, allow all values for the specified attribute.

	      !*     Never Equal, disallow all values for the specified attribute.
		     ( This is redundant, as any A/V Pair not explicitly permitted
		     will be dropped ).

	      !=     Not Equal, value must not match.

	      >=     Greater Than or Equal

	      <=     Less Than or Equal

	      >      Greater Than

	      <      Less Than

	      If regular expressions are enabled the following operators are
	      also possible.  ( Regular Expressions are included by default
	      unless your system doesn't support them, which should be rare ).
	      The value field uses standard regular expression syntax.


	      =~     Regular Expression Equal

	      !~     Regular Expression Not Equal

	      See the default /etc/raddb/attrs for working examples of
	      sample rule ordering and how to use the different operators.


       The configuration items are:

       file   This  specifies the location of the file used to load the filter
	      rules.  This file is used to  filter  the  accounting  response,
	      packet  before  it  is  proxied,	proxy  response  from the home
	      server, or our response to the NAS.

       key    Usually %{Realm} (the default).  Can also  be  %{User-Name},  or
	      other  attribute that exists in the request.  Note that the mod-
	      ule always keys off of attributes in the request, and NOT in any
	      other packet.

       relaxed
	      If  set  to 'yes', then attributes which do not match any filter
	      rules explicitly, will also be allowed. This  behaviour  may  be
	      overridden for an individual filter block using the Relax-Filter
	      check item.  The default for this configuration item is 'no'.


SECTIONS
       preacct
	      Filters Accounting-Request packets.

       accounting

	      Access-Challenge responses from a home server.

       authorize
	      Filters Access-Request packets.

       post-auth
