NAME
       radcrypt  -  generate password hash for use with radius, or validates a
       password hash

SYNOPSIS
       radcrypt   [-d|--des]   [-m|--md5]   [-c|--check]    plaintext_password
       [hashed_password]

DESCRIPTION
       radcrypt generates a hashed digest of a plaintext password, or can val-
       idate if a password hash matches a plaintext password. When  generating
       a  password  hash a random salt is generated and applied. radcrypt only
       currently supports the older DES and MD5 hashes.

       Current best practice is to use certificate-based authentication rather
       than  relying  on  passwords.  However,	other  external  tools such as
       openssl can generate  high  quality  hashed  and  salted  passwords  if
       needed, e.g. "echo -n 'password' | openssl dgst -sha512". Although more
       modern hashes such as bcrypt, SSHA3, and SSHA2  are  not  supported  by
       radcrypt, hashes are supported in the server by rlm_pap(5).

       A  hashed  password  can  be  validated by specifying -c or --check and
       passing hashed_password after plaintext_password on the	command  line.
       In  this  case  hashed_password	will  be  checked to see if it matches
       plaintext_password. If so "Password OK" will be printed	and  the  exit
       status  will  be  1,  otherwise "Password BAD" will be printed and exit
       status will be 0 (Note this is the  opposite  of  a  normal  successful
       shell status).


OPTIONS
       -d --des
	      Use a DES (Data Encryption Standard) hash (default).  Ignored if
	      performing a password check.

       -m --md5
	      Use a MD5 (Message Digest 5)  hash.   Ignored  if  performing  a
	      password check.

       -c --check
	      Perform  a  validation  check on a password hash to verify if it
	      matches the plantext password.


EXAMPLES
       $ radcrypt foobar
       HaX0xn7Qy650Q
       $ radcrypt -c foobar HaX0xn7Qy650Q
       Password OK
