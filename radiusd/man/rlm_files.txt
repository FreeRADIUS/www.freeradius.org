rlm_files(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		  rlm_files(5)



NAME
       rlm_files - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_files module uses the 'users' file for accessing authorization
       information for users.  Additionally, it supports a 'users' file syntax
       to be applied to the accounting and pre-proxy sections.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       usersfile
	      The  filename  of  the  'users' file, which is parsed during the
	      authorization stage of this module.

       acctusersfile
	      The filename of the 'users' file, which  is  parsed  during  the
	      accounting stage of this module.

       preproxy_usersfile
	      The  filename  of  the  'users' file, which is parsed during the
	      pre_proxy stage of this module.

       compat This option allows FreeRADIUS to parse an old style Cistron syn-
	      tax.   The  default  is 'no'.  If you need to parse an old style
	      Cistron file, set this option to 'cistron'.

       key    This option lets you set the attribute to use as a key  to  find
	      entries.	 The default is "%{Stripped-User-Name:-%{User-Name}}".
	      Note that the key MUST supply  real  data.   Dynamic  attributes
	      like  "Group"  will  not work, because the "Group" attribute can
	      only be used as a comparison, to see if a  user  is  in  a  Unix
	      group.   It  will  not  return the name of the Unix group that a
	      user is in.

       If you want to use groups as a key, see the rlm_passed, which will cre-
       ate a real attribute that contains the group name.

       This  configuration  entry enables you to have configurations that per-
       form per-group checks, and return per-group attributes, where the group
       membership  is  dynamically defined by a previous module.  It also lets
       you do things like key off of attributes  in  the  reply,  and  express
       policies  like  like "when I send replies containing attribute FOO with
       value BAR, do more checks, and maybe send additional attributes".
