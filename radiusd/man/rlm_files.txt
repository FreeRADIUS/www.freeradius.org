rlm_files(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		  rlm_files(5)



NAME
       rlm_files - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_files module uses the 'users' file for accessing authorization
       information for users.  Additionally, it supports a 'users' file syntax
       to be applied to the accounting and pre-proxy sections.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       usersfile
	      The  filename  of  the  'users' file, which is parsed during the
	      authorization stage of this module.

       acctusersfile
	      The filename of the 'users' file, which  is  parsed  during  the
	      accounting stage of this module.

       preproxy_usersfile
	      The  filename  of  the  'users' file, which is parsed during the
	      pre_proxy stage of this module.

       compat This option allows FreeRADIUS to parse an old style Cistron syn-
	      tax.   The  default  is 'no'.  If you need to parse an old style
	      Cistron file, set this option to 'cistron'.
