rlm_chap(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		   rlm_chap(5)



NAME
       rlm_chap - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The rlm_chap module provides CHAP functionality.

       This  module  validates	a user with CHAP authentication.  If called in
       Authorize, it will look	for  CHAP-Password  attribute  in  the	Acess-
       Request and adds an Auth-Type attribute set to CHAP if the Config-Items
       list unless Auth-Type has already set.

       CHAP authentication requires access to the clear-text password for  the
       user.   Standard  Unix system authentication or passwords encrypted via
       crypt() are not compatible with CHAP.
