       The FreeRadius server can be configured to maintain an  active  session
       database  in  a  file  called _r_a_d_u_t_m_p. Commands like rraaddwwhhoo(1) use this
       database. Sometimes that database can get out  of  sync,  and  then  it
       might contain rogue entries. rraaddzzaapp can clean up this database.

       As  of FreeRADIUS 1.0.3, rraaddzzaapp is a simple shell-script wrapper around
       rraaddwwhhoo(1) and rraaddcclliieenntt(1).

       The sessions are "zapped" by sending an Accounting-Request packet which
       contains the information necessary for the server to delete the session
       record.  rraaddzzaapp sends a packet to the server, rather  than  writing  to
       _r_a_d_u_t_m_p  directly,  because  session  records may also be maintained in
       SQL.

       -d _r_a_d_d_b___d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              The directory that  contains  the  RADIUS  configuration  files.
              rraaddzzaapp  reads  _r_a_d_i_u_s_d_._c_o_n_f  to  determine  the  location of the
              _r_a_d_u_t_m_p file.

       -N _n_a_s___i_p___a_d_d_r_e_s_s
              Zap the entries which match the given NAS IP address.

       -P _n_a_s___p_o_r_t
              Zap the entries which match the given NAS port.

       -u _u_s_e_r
              Zap the entries which match the given  username  (case  insensi‚Äê
              tive).

       -U _u_s_e_r
              Zap the entries which match the given username (case sensitive).

       server[:port]
              The hostname or IP address of the remote  server.  Optionally  a
              UDP  port  can  be specified. If no UDP port is specified, it is
              looked up in _/_e_t_c_/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s.  The  service  name  looked  for  is
              rraaddaacccctt  for  accounting  packets,  and  rraaddiiuuss  for  all  other
              requests. If a service is not found in _/_e_t_c_/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s,  1813  and
              1812 are used respectively.

       secret The  shared  secret  for this client.  It needs to be defined on
              the radius server side too, for the IP address you  are  sending
              the radius packets from.
