RADZAP(1)		       FreeRadius Daemon		     RADZAP(1)



NAME
       radzap - remove rogue entries from the active sessions database

SYNOPSIS
       radzap  [-d raddb_directory] [-h] [-N nas_ip_address] [-P nas_port] [-u
       user] [-U user] [-x] server[:port] secret

DESCRIPTION
       The FreeRadius server can be configured to maintain an  active  session
       database  in  a	file  called radutmp. Commands like radwho(1) use this
       database. Sometimes that database can get out  of  sync,  and  then  it
       might contain rogue entries. radzap can clean up this database.

       As  of FreeRADIUS 1.1.0, radzap is a simple shell-script wrapper around
       radwho(1) and radclient(1).

       The sessions are "zapped" by sending an Accounting-Request packet which
       contains the information necessary for the server to delete the session
       record.	radzap sends a packet to the server, rather  than  writing  to
       radutmp	directly,  because  session  records may also be maintained in
       SQL.

OPTIONS
       -d raddb_directory
	      The directory that  contains  the  RADIUS  configuration	files.
	      radzap  reads  radiusd.conf  to  determine  the  location of the
	      radutmp file.

       -h     Print usage help information.

       -N nas_ip_address
	      Zap the entries which match the given NAS IP address.

       -P nas_port
	      Zap the entries which match the given NAS port.

       -u user
	      Zap the entries which match the given  username  (case  insensi-
	      tive).

       -U user
	      Zap the entries which match the given username (case sensitive).

       -x     Enable debugging output.

       server[:port]
	      The hostname or IP address of the remote	server.  Optionally  a
	      UDP  port  can  be specified. If no UDP port is specified, it is
	      looked up in /etc/services.  The	service  name  looked  for  is
	      radacct  for  accounting	packets,  and  radius  for  all  other
	      requests. If a service is not found in /etc/services,  1813  and
	      1812 are used respectively.

       secret The  shared  secret  for this client.  It needs to be defined on
	      the radius server side too, for the IP address you  are  sending
	      the radius packets from.
