NAME
       rlm_attr_rewrite - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_attr_rewrite  module provides functionality to rewrite data in
       radius packets on the fly.  This can be	useful	in  authorization  and
       accounting functions.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       attribute
	      The name of the attribute that you want to be rewritten

       searchfor
	      String to be replaced.

       searchin
	      Where  to  look  for  the  attribute.  Valid values are: packet,
	      reply, proxy, proxy_reply, config

       replacewith
	      String to replace "searchfor".

       append Set to yes or no.  If set to yes then the replace string will be
	      appended to the original string.

       ignore_case
	      Set to yes or no.  Determines whether search will be case insen-
	      sitive or case sensitive.

       new_attribute
	      Set to yes or no.  If set to yes, then  new  attribute  will  be
	      created  with  values  from "searchin" and "replacewith".  Other
	      options will be ignored.

       max_matches
	      Set the max number of attributes to match against.  This is use-
	      ful if you need to rewrite the value in multiple Vendor Specific
	      Attributes.
