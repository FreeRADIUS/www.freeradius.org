RADWHO(1)		       FreeRADIUS Daemon		     RADWHO(1)



NAME
       radwho - show online users

SYNOPSIS
       radwho  [-c]  [-d  raddb_directory]  [-f] [-i] [-n] [-N nas_ip_address]
       [-p] [-P nas_port] [-r] [-R] [-s] [-S] [-u user] [-U user] [-Z]

DESCRIPTION
       The FreeRADIUS server can be configured to maintain an  active  session
       database  in  a	file called radutmp. This utility shows the content of
       that session database.

OPTIONS
       -c     Shows caller ID (if available) instead of the full name.

       -d raddb_directory
	      The directory that  contains  the  RADIUS  configuration	files.
	      Defaults to /etc/raddb.

       -f     Behave  as  the  'fingerd' daemon - waits for one line of input,
	      then prints the output with lines \r\n terminated.

       -i     Shows the session ID instead of the full name.

       -n     Normally radwho looks up the username in	the  systems  password
	      file, and shows the full username as well. The -n flags prevents
	      this.

       -N nas_ip_address
	      Show only those entries which match the given NAS IP address.

       -p     Adds an extra column for the port type - I for ISDN, A for  Ana-
	      log.

       -P nas_port
	      Show only those entries which match the given NAS port.

       -r     Outputs  all  data  in  raw  format - no headers, no formatting,
	      fields are comma-separated.

       -R     Output all data in RADIUS  attribute  format.   All  fields  are
	      printed.

       -s     Show full name.

       -S     Hide shell users. Doesn't show the entries for users that do not
	      have a SLIP or PPP session.

       -u user
	      Show only those entries which match  the	given  username  (case
	      insensitive).

       -U user
	      Show  only  those  entries  which match the given username (case
	      sensitive).

       -Z     When combined with -R, prints out the contents of an Accounting-
	      Request  packet  which  can  be passed to radclient, in order to
	      "zap" that users session from radutmp.

       For example,

	      $ radwho -ZRN 10.0.0.1 | radclient -f - radius.example.net acct testing123

       will result in all an  Accounting-Request  packet  being  sent  to  the
       RADIUS  server,	which tells the server that the NAS rebooted.  i.e. It
       "zaps" all of the users on that NAS.

       To "zap" one user, specifiy NAS, username, and NAS port:

	      $ radwho -ZRN 10.0.0.1 -u user -P 10 | radclient -f - radius.example.net acct testing123

       Other combinations are also possible.
