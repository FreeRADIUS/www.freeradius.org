RADWHO(1)		       FreeRADIUS Daemon		     RADWHO(1)



NAME
       radwho - show online users

SYNOPSIS
       radwho  [-d  raddb_directory]  [-l]  [-h] [-f] [-n] [-s] [-i] [-p] [-c]
       [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       The FreeRADIUS server can be configured to maintain an  active  session
       database  in  a	file called radutmp. This utility shows the content of
       that session database.

OPTIONS
       -d raddb_directory
	      The directory that  contains  the  RADIUS  configuration	files.
	      Defaults to /etc/raddb.

       -l     Show local shell users too. In this case, radwho reads the local
	      "session database" aka the systems utmp file as well  and  shows
	      the  contents  of  that  file  before the contents of the radius
	      "session database" aka the radutmp file, in the same format.

       -h     Hide shell users. Doesn't show the entries for users that do not
	      have a SLIP or PPP session.

       -f     Behave  as  the  'fingerd' daemon - waits for one line of input,
	      then prints the output with lines \r\n terminated.

       -n     Normally radwho looks up the username in	the  systems  password
	      file, and shows the full username as well. The -n flags prevents
	      this.

       -s     Show full name.

       -i     Shows the session ID instead of the full name.

       -p     Adds an extra column for the port type - I for ISDN, A for  Ana-
	      log.

       -c     Shows caller ID (if available) instead of the full name.

       -r     Outputs  all  data  in  raw  format - no headers, no formatting,
	      fields are comma-seperated.
