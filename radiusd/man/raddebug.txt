NAME
       raddebug - Display debugging output from a running server.

SYNOPSIS
       raddebug  [-c  condition]  [-d  config_directory] [-i ipv4-address] [-I
       ipv6-address] [-f socket_file] [-t timeout] [-u user-name]

DESCRIPTION
       raddebug is a shell script wrapper around  radmin  that	automates  the
       process	of  obtaining debugging output from a running server.  It does
       this without impacting service availability, unlike using  radiusd  -X.
       There  are  a  number of prerequisites that are required for its proper
       operation:

	  * radmin must be available in the PATH.
	  * The user running raddebug must have permission to connect to
	    the server control socket.
	  * The control socket must be configured.  For instructions, see
	    raddb/sites-available/control-socket
	  * The control socket must be marked as "mode = rw".
	  * The user running raddebug must have permission to read and
	    write files in the "logdir" directory.  This is usually
	    /var/log/radiusd.

       For a number of reasons, the debugging output is placed in an  interme-
       diate  file,  rather  than  being sent directly to standard output.  In
       order to prevent this file from growing too large, the raddebug program
       is  automatically  terminated  after  10  seconds.  This timeout can be
       changed via the "-t" parameter.

       When the script exits, debug mode in the server is  disabled,  and  the
       intermediate file is deleted.

       Debug output from a live server can be redirected to only one location.
       If a second instance of raddebug is started  while  the	first  one  is
       still  running,	the  later  one  will over-ride the first one, and the
       first will stop producing output.

OPTIONS
       -c condition
	      Set a specific debug condition.  The format of the condition  is
	      as  specified  in  the  CONDITIONS  section of the unlang manual
	      page.

       -f socket_file
	      The path to the control socket.  See the radmin manual page  for
	      more description of this option.

       -i ipv4-address
	      Show  debug output for the client having the given IPv4 address.
	      This option is equivalent to using:
		 -c '(Packet-Src-IP-Address == ipv4-address)'

       -d config directory
	      The radius configuration directory, usually /etc/raddb.  See the
	      radmin manual page for more description of this option.

       -I ipv6-address
	      Show  debug output for the client having the given IPv6 address.
	      This option is equivalent to using:
		 -c '(Packet-Src-IPv6-Address == ipv6-address)'

       -t timeout
	      Stop printing debug output after "timeout" seconds.  The default
	      timeout  is  sixty  (60) seconds.  Use "-t 0" to print debugging
	      output forever, or until the script exits.

       -u name
	      Show debug output for users having the given name.  This	option
	      is equivalent to using:
		 -c '(User-Name == name)'
