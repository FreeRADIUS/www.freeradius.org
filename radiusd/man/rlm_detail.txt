rlm_detail(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		 rlm_detail(5)



NAME
       rlm_detail - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_detail	module writes radius packets to 'detail' files.  It is
       primarily used for storing accounting information, but can be  used  in
       other sections to write packet details as well.

       The  file  format is similar to that of the old Livingston servers, and
       many 'detail' file parsers should work with FreeRADIUS.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       detailfile
	      The file name in which  to  store  the  radius  packet  records.
	      NOTE: this variable is run through dynamic string expansion, and
	      can include FreeRADIUS variables to create a dynamic filename.

	    %{radacctdir}/%{Client-IP-Address}/detail-%Y%m

	    This will create one file per month, for each client.
	    This accomplishes 'file rotation' automatically from
	    within the server.


       detailperm
	      The file permissions of the detailfile.  If omitted, the default
	      is 0600.

       dirperm
	      The  directory  permissions  of  the  directory where the detail
	      files are created.  The default is 0755.

       locking
	      This option is set to 'yes' or 'no'.  By	default  it  is  'no'.
	      Set  this  to yes to enable file locking, which is used with the
	      'radrelay' program.
