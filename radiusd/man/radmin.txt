NAME
       radmin - FreeRADIUS Administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       radmin	[-d   config_directory]  [-e  command]	[-f  socket_file]  [-i
       input_file] [-n name] [-o output_file] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
       FreeRADIUS Server administration tool  that  connects  to  the  control
       socket of a running server, and gives a command-line interface to it.

       At this time, only a few commands are supported.  Please type "help" at
       the command prompt for detailed information about  the  supported  com-
       mands.

WARNING
       This tool is experimental and should not be used in production environ-
       ments.  Changes may be made at any time to the commands accepted by the
       server, and/or to the resulting output.

       The  security  protections  offered by this command are pretty minimal.
       If someone has permission to connect to the server, they can do	almost
       anything, from stopping the server, to changing its configuration.

       Please exercise caution when using this command!

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are accepted by the program.

       -d config directory
	      Defaults to /etc/raddb. radmin looks here for the server config-
	      uration files to find the "listen" section that defines the con-
	      trol socket filename.

       -e command
	      Run command and exit.

       -f socket_file
	      Specify  the socket filename directly.  The radiusd.conf file is
	      not read.

       -i input_file
	      Reads input from the specified file.  If not specified, stdin is
	      used.  This also sets "-q".

       -n mname
	      Read raddb/name.conf instead of raddb/radiusd.conf.

       -o output_file
	      Write output to the specified file.  If not specified, stdout is
	      used.  This also sets "-q".

       -q     Quiet mode.

COMMANDS
       The commands implemented by the command-line interface are almost  com-
       pletely controlled by the server.  There are a few commands interpreted
       locally by radmin:

       reconnect
	      Reconnect to the server.

       quit   Exit from radmin.

       exit   Exit from radmin.

       The other commands are implemented by the server.  Type "help"  at  the
       prompt for more information.

EXAMPLES
       debug file /var/log/radius/bob.log
	      Set debug logs to /var/log/radius/bob.log.  There is very little
	      checking of this filename.  Rogue administrators may be able use
	      this  command  to  over-write almost any file on the system.  If
	      those administrators have write access  to  "radius.conf",  they
	      can do the same thing without radmin, too.

       debug condition '(User-Name == "bob")'
	      Enable  debugging  output for all requests that match the condi-
	      tion.  Any "unlang" condition is valid here.  The  condition  is
	      parsed  as  a string, so it must be enclosed in single or double
	      quotes.  Strings	enclosed  in  double-quotes  must  have  back-
	      slashes and the quotation marks escaped inside of the string.

	      Only one debug condition can be active at a time.

       debug condition '((User-Name == "bob") || (Packet-Src-IP-
       Address == 192.0.2.22))'
	      A  more  complex	condition  that  enables  debugging output for
	      requests containing User-Name "bob", or requests that  originate
	      from source IP address 192.0.2.22.

       debug condition
	      Disable debug conditionals.
