NAME
       radmin - FreeRADIUS Administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       radmin  [-d  config_directory]  [-e command] [-E] [-f socket_file] [-h]
       [-i input_file] [-n name] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
       FreeRADIUS Server administration tool  that  connects  to  the  control
       socket of a running server, and gives a command-line interface to it.

       At this time, only a few commands are supported.  Please type "help" at
       the command prompt for detailed information about  the  supported  com-
       mands.

WARNING
       The  security  protections  offered  by this command are limited to the
       permissions on the Unix domain socket, and  the	server	configuration.
       If  someone can connect to the Unix domain socket, they have a substan-
       tial amount of control over the server.

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are accepted by the program.

       -d config directory
	      Defaults to /etc/raddb. radmin looks here for the server config-
	      uration files to find the "listen" section that defines the con-
	      trol socket filename.

       -e command
	      Run command and exit.

       -E     Echo commands as they are being executed.

       -f socket_file
	      Specify the socket filename directly.  The radiusd.conf file  is
	      not read.

       -h     Print usage help information.

       -i input_file
	      Reads input from the specified file.  If not specified, stdin is
	      used.  This also sets "-q".

       -n mname
	      Read raddb/name.conf instead of raddb/radiusd.conf.

       -q     Quiet mode.

COMMANDS
       The commands implemented by the command-line interface are almost  com-
       pletely controlled by the server.  There are a few commands interpreted
       locally by radmin:

       reconnect
	      Reconnect to the server.

       quit   Exit from radmin.

       exit   Exit from radmin.

       The other commands are implemented by the server.  Type "help"  at  the
       prompt for more information.

EXAMPLES
       debug file /var/log/radius/bob.log
	      Set debug logs to /var/log/radius/bob.log.  There is very little
	      checking of this filename.  Rogue administrators may be able use
	      this  command  to  over-write almost any file on the system.  If
	      those administrators have write access  to  "radius.conf",  they
	      can do the same thing without radmin, too.

       debug condition '(User-Name == "bob")'
	      Enable  debugging  output for all requests that match the condi-
	      tion.  Any "unlang" condition is valid here.  The  condition  is
	      parsed  as  a string, so it must be enclosed in single or double
	      quotes.  Strings	enclosed  in  double-quotes  must  have  back-
	      slashes and the quotation marks escaped inside of the string.

	      Only one debug condition can be active at a time.

       debug  condition  '((User-Name  ==  "bob") || (Packet-Src-IP-Address ==
       192.0.2.22))'
	      A  more  complex	condition  that  enables  debugging output for
	      requests containing User-Name "bob", or requests that  originate
	      from source IP address 192.0.2.22.

       debug condition
	      Disable debug conditionals.
