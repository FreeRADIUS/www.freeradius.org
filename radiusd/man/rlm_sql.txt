rlm_sql(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		    rlm_sql(5)



NAME
       rlm_sql - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_sql module provides an SQL interface to retrieve authorization
       information and store accounting information.  It can be used  in  con-
       junction  with,	or  in	lieu of the files and detail modules.  The SQL
       module has drivers to support the following SQL databases:


		   db2
		   iodbc
		   mysql
		   oracle
		   postgresql
		   sybase
		   unixodbc


       Due to the size of the configuration variables, the sql module is  usu-
       ally  configured  in  a	separate  file,  which is included in the main
       radiusd.conf via an include directive.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       driver This variable specifies the driver to be loaded.

       server

       login

       password
	      These specify the servername, username, and password the	module
	      will use to connect to the database.

       radius_db
	      The name of the database where the radius tables are stored.

       acct_table1

       acct_table2
	      These specify the tables names for accounting records.  acct_ta-
	      ble1  specifies  the  table  where  Start  records  are  stored.
	      acct_table2  specifies  the table where Stop records are stored.
	      In most cases, this should be the same table.

       postauth_table
	      The name of the table to store post-authentication data.

       authcheck_table

       authreply_table
	      The tables where	individual  Check-Items  and  Reply-Items  are
	      stored.

       groupcheck_table

       groupreply_table
	      The tables where group Check-Items and Reply-Items are stored.

       usergroup_table
	      The table where username to group relationships are stored.

       deletestatlesessions
	      This  option is set to 'yes' or 'no'.  If you are doing Simulta-
	      neous-Use checking, and this is set to  yes,  stale  sessions  (
	      defined  as  sessions for which a Stop record was not received )
	      will be cleared.

       sqltrace

       sqltracefile
	      These two options are useful for	debugging  sql	problems.   If
	      sqltrace	is set to yes, then all sql queries being executed are
	      written to the file listed in sqltracefile.  This is disabled in
	      normal operation.

       num_sql_socks
	      The number of sql connections to make to the database.

       connect_failure_retry_delay
	      The  number of seconds to wait before attempting to reconnect to
	      a failed database connection.

       sql_user_name
	      This is the definition of the SQL-User-Name attribute.  This  is
	      set  once,  so  that  you  can  use  %{SQL-User-Name} in the SQL
	      queries, rather than the	nested	username  substitution.   This
	      ensures that Username is parsed consistently for all SQL queries
	      executed.

       default_user_profile
	      This is the default profile name that will  be  applied  to  all
	      users if set.  This is not set by default.

       query_on_not_found
	      This  option  is	set to 'yes' or 'no'.  If set to yes, then the
	      default user profile is returned if no specific match was  found
	      for the user.

       authorize_check_query

       authorize_reply_query
	      These  queries are run during the authorization stage to extract
	      the user authorization information from  the  ${authcheck_table}
	      and ${authreply_table}.

       authorize_group_check_query

       authorize_group_reply_query
	      These  queries are run during the authorization stage to extract
	      the group authorization information from the ${groupcheck_table}
	      and ${groupreply_table}.

       accounting_onoff_query
	      The  query to be run when receiving an Accounting On or Account-
	      ing Off packet.

       accounting_update_query

       accounting_update_query_alt
	      The query to be run when receiving an Accounting Update  packet.
	      If the primary query fails, the alt query is run.

       accounting_start_query

       accounting_start_query_alt
	      The  query  to be run when receiving an Accounting Start packet.
	      If the primary query fails, the alt query is run.

       accounting_stop_query

       accounting_stop_query_alt
	      The query to be run when receiving an  Accounting  Stop  packet.
	      If the primary query fails, the alt query is run.

       simul_count_query
	      The  query  to be run to return the number simultaneous sessions
	      for the purposes of limiting Simultaneous Use.

       simul_verify_query
	      The query to return the detail  information  needed  to  confirm
	      that  all  suspected  connected  sessions are valid, and are not
	      stale sessions.

       group_membership_query
	      The query to run to check user group membership.

       postauth_query
	      The query to run during the post-authentication stage.
