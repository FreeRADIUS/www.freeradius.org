dictionary - RADIUS dictionary file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <I>dictionary</I> file resides in the radius database directory,
by default <I>/etc/raddb</I>. It contains a list of RADIUS attributes
and values, which the server uses to map between descriptive names and
on-the-wire data.  The names have no meaning outside of the RADIUS
server itself, and are never exchanged between server and clients.
<P>
Every line starting with a hash sign
('<B>#</B>')

is treated as comment and ignored.
<P>

Each line of the file can contain one of the following strings
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ATTRIBUTE name  number  type [vendor|options]</B>

<DD>
Define a RADIUS attribute name to number mapping.  The <I>name</I>
field can be any non-space text, but is usually taken from
<I>RFC2865</I>, and other related documents.  The <I>number</I> field is
also taken from the relevant documents, for that name.  The <I>type</I>
field can be one of <I>string</I>, <I>octets</I>, <I>ipaddr</I>,
<I>integer</I>, <I>date</I>, <I>ifid</I>, <I>ipv6addr</I>,
<I>ipv6prefix</I>, or <I>abinary</I>.  See the RFC's, or the main
<I>dictionary</I> file for a description of the various types.
<P>
The last (optional) field of an attribute definition can have either a
vendor name, or options for that attribute.  When a vendor name is
given, the attribute is defined to be a vendor specific attribute.
Alternately, the options may be the a comma-separated list of the
following options:
<P>
<DT>
<DD>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>encrypt=[1-3]<BR>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Mark the attribute as being encrypted with one of three methods.  &quot;1&quot;
means that the attribute is encrypted with the method as defined in
<I>RFC2865</I> for the User-Password attribute.  &quot;2&quot; means that the
password is encrypted with the method as defined in <I>RFC2868</I> for
the Tunnel-Password attribute.  &quot;3&quot; means that the attribute is
encrypted as per Ascend's definitions for the Ascend-Send-Secret attribute.
</DL>

<P>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>has_tag<BR>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Mark the attribute as being permitted to have a tag, as defined in
<I>RFC2868</I>.  The purpose of the tag is to allow grouping of
attributes for tunnelled users.  See <I>RFC2868</I> for more details.
</DL>

<P>
When the server receives an encoded attribute in a RADIUS packet, it
looks up that attribute by number in the dictionary, and uses the name
found there for printing diagnostic and log messages.
<P>
<DT><B>VALUE attribute-name value-name number</B>

<DD>
Define an attribute value name to number mapping, for an attribute of
type <I>integer</I>.  The <I>attribute-name</I> field MUST be previously
defined by an <I>ATTRIBUTE</I> entry.  The <I>value-name</I> field can
be any non-space text, but is usually taken from <I>RFC2865</I>, or
other documents..  The <I>number</I> field is also taken from the
relevant documents, for that name.
<P>
When the server receives an encoded value in a RADIUS packet, it looks
up the value of that attribute by number in the dictionary, and uses
the name found there for printing diagnostic and log messages.
<P>
<DT><B>VENDOR vendor-name number</B>

<DD>
Define a Vendor Specific Attribute encapsulation for <I>vendor-name</I>
to <I>number</I>.  For a list of vendor names and numbers, see
<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt.">http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt.</A>
<P>
<DT><B>$INCLUDE filename</B>

<DD>
Include dictionary entries from the file <I>filename</I>.  The
<I>filename</I> is taken as relative to the location of the file which
is asking for the inclusion.
