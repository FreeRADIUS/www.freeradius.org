<H2>NAME</H2>

dictionary - RADIUS dictionary file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The master RADIUS dictionary file resides in
<I>/etc/raddb/dictionary</I>.  It references other <I>dictionary</I>
files located in <I>/usr/local/share/freeradius/</I>.  Each dictionary
file contains a list of RADIUS attributes and values, which the server
uses to map between descriptive names and on-the-wire data.  The names
have no meaning outside of the RADIUS server itself, and are never
exchanged between server and clients.
<P>

That is, editing the dictionaries will have NO EFFECT on anything
other than the server that is reading those files.  Adding new
attributes to the dictionaries will have NO EFFECT on RADIUS clients,
and will not make RADIUS clients magically understand those
attributes.  The dictionaries are solely for local administrator
convenience, and are specific to each version of FreeRADIUS.
<P>

The dictionaries in <I>/usr/local/share</I> SHOULD NOT be edited unless
you know exactly what you are doing.  Changing them will most likely
break your RADIUS deployment.
<P>

If you need to add new attributes, please edit the
<I>/etc/raddb/dictionary</I> file.  It's sole purpose is to contain
site-local definitions that are added by the local administrator.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FORMAT</H2>

Every line starting with a hash sign
('<B>#</B>')

is treated as comment and ignored.
<P>

Each line of the file can contain one of the following strings:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ATTRIBUTE name  oid  type [flags]</B>

<DD>
Define a RADIUS attribute name to number mapping.
<P>
The <I>name</I> field is a printable field, taken from various
specifications or vendor definitions.  It is most commonly used as a
series of words, separated by hyphens.  e.g. &quot;User-Name&quot;.
Vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) are prefixed by the vendor name,
e.g. &quot;Cisco-AVPair&quot;.  The names should be globally unique, as they are
used as a key to look up the properties of the attribute.
<P>
The <I>oid</I> field is taken from the relevant specification for that
name.  In most cases, it is a decimal number, such as &quot;256&quot;.  For
certain attributes, a &quot;dotted number&quot; notation is used, e.g. &quot;1.2&quot;.
The &quot;dotted number&quot; notation is used only for certain attributes.
<P>
The <I>type</I> field can be one of the standard types:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UTF-8&nbsp;printable&nbsp;text&nbsp;(the&nbsp;RFCs&nbsp;call&nbsp;this&nbsp;&quot;text&quot;)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;octets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opaque&nbsp;binary&nbsp;data&nbsp;(the&nbsp;RFCs&nbsp;call&nbsp;this&nbsp;&quot;string&quot;)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ipaddr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPv4&nbsp;address
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seconds&nbsp;since&nbsp;January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1970&nbsp;(32-bits)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32-bit&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;integer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ipv6addr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPv6&nbsp;Address
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ipv6prefix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPV6&nbsp;prefix,&nbsp;with&nbsp;mask
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ifid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;Id&nbsp;(hex:hex:hex:hex)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer64<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;64-bit&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;integer<BR>
<P>
The <I>type</I> field can also be one of the following non-standard types:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ether&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;MAC&nbsp;address
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abinary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascend&nbsp;binary&nbsp;filter&nbsp;format
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8-bit&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;integer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16-bit&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;integer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31-bit&nbsp;signed&nbsp;integer&nbsp;(packed&nbsp;into&nbsp;32-bit&nbsp;field)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed-size&nbsp;structures
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tlv&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type-Length-Value&nbsp;(allows&nbsp;nested&nbsp;attributes)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ipv4prefix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPv4&nbsp;Prefix&nbsp;as&nbsp;given&nbsp;in&nbsp;RFC&nbsp;6572.
<P>
The &quot;struct&quot; type is a compound type.  An attribute of data type
&quot;struct&quot; can have multiple sub-attributes defined, just as with TLVs.
Each sub-attribute has to be numbered sequentially, starting at 1.
The numbers allow tracking of individual sub-fields, but have no other
meaning.  Each sub-field of a &quot;struct&quot; type MUST be a fixed-width data
type such as &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;ipaddr&quot;, etc.  Variable sized types such as
&quot;string&quot;, &quot;octets&quot;, or &quot;tlv&quot; are not allowed.  Structs may not contain
other structs.
<P>
The last (optional) field of an attribute definition are additional
flags for that attribute, in a comma-separated list.  Previous
versions of the server allowed these flags to include a vendor name.
This behavior may still work, but it is deprecated, and is not
recommended.
<P>
The options are:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encrypt=#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;encryption&nbsp;type&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;or&nbsp;3.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has_tag&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;can&nbsp;have&nbsp;an&nbsp;RFC&nbsp;2868&nbsp;style&nbsp;tag
<P>
The &quot;encrypt&quot; flag marks the attribute as being encrypted with one of
three possible methods.  &quot;1&quot; means that the attribute is encrypted
with the method as defined in <I>RFC2865</I> for the User-Password
attribute.  &quot;2&quot; means that the password is encrypted with the method
as defined in <I>RFC2868</I> for the Tunnel-Password attribute.  &quot;3&quot;
means that the attribute is encrypted as per Ascend's definitions for
the Ascend-Send-Secret attribute.
<P>
The &quot;has_tag&quot; flag marks the attribute as being permitted to have a
tag, as defined in <I>RFC2868</I>.  The purpose of the tag is to allow
grouping of attributes for tunneled users.  See <I>RFC2868</I> for
more details.
<P>
When the server receives an encoded attribute in a RADIUS packet, it
looks up that attribute by number in the dictionary, and uses the
definition found there for printing diagnostic and log messages.  When
the server sees an attribute name in a configuration file, it looks up
that attribute by name in the dictionary, and uses the definition
found there.
<P>
<DT><B>FLAGS flag-name</B>

<DD>
Set attribute flags for all subsequent attributes.  Flags can be
unset by prefixing them with the &quot;!&quot; character.
<P>
The only flag currently supported is &quot;internal&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>VALUE attribute-name value-name number</B>

<DD>
Define an attribute value name to number mapping, for an attribute of
type <I>integer</I>.  The <I>attribute-name</I> field MUST be previously
defined by an <I>ATTRIBUTE</I> entry.  The <I>value-name</I> field can
be any non-space text, but is usually taken from <I>RFC2865</I>, or
other documents..  The <I>number</I> field is also taken from the
relevant documents, for that name.
<P>
When the server receives an encoded value in a RADIUS packet, it looks
up the value of that attribute by number in the dictionary, and uses
the name found there for printing diagnostic and log messages.
<DT><B>VENDOR vendor-name number [format=...]</B>

<DD>
Define a Vendor Specific Attribute encapsulation for <I>vendor-name</I>
to <I>number</I>.  For a list of vendor names and numbers, see
<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt.">http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt.</A>
<P>
The &quot;format=t,l&quot; statement tells the server how many octets to use to
encode/decode the vendor &quot;type&quot; and &quot;length&quot; fields in the attributes.
The default is &quot;format=1,1&quot;, which does not have to be specified.  For
USR VSA's, the format is &quot;format=4,0&quot;, for Lucent VSA's it's
&quot;format=2,1&quot;, and for Starent VSA's it's &quot;format=2,2&quot;.
<P>
The supported values for the number of type octets (i.e. the first
digit) are 1, 2, and 4.  The support values for the number of length
octets (i.e. the second digit) are 0, 1, and 2.  Any combination of
those values will work.
<P>
<DT><B>BEGIN-VENDOR vendor-name</B>

<DD>
Define the start of a block of Vendor-Specific attributes.  All of the
following <I>ATTRIBUTE</I>  definitions are interpreted as being for the
named vendor, until the block is closed by an &quot;END-VENDOR&quot; statement.
<P>
This practice is preferred to placing the vendor name at the end of an
<I>ATTRIBUTE</I>  definition.
<P>
For VSAs in the RFC 6929 &quot;Extended vendor-specific&quot; space, a format
can be specified following the &quot;vendor-name&quot;.  The format should be
&quot;format=Extended-Vendor-Specific-1&quot;, through
&quot;format=Extended-Vendor-Specific-6&quot;.  The matching &quot;END-VENDOR&quot; should
just have the &quot;vendor-name&quot;, without the format string.
<DT><B>END-VENDOR vendor-name</B>

<DD>
End a previously defined BEGIN-VENDOR block.  The &quot;vendor-name&quot; must match.
<DT><B>$INCLUDE filename</B>

<DD>
Include dictionary entries from the file <I>filename</I>.  The
<I>filename</I> is taken as relative to the location of the file which
is asking for the inclusion.
<DT><B>BEGIN-TLV name</B>

<DD>
This feature is supported for backwards compatibility with older
dictionaries.  It should not be used.  The new &quot;oid&quot; form for defining
the attribute number should be used instead.
<DT><B>END-TLV name</B>

<DD>
This feature is supported for backwards compatibility with older
dictionaries.  It should not be used.  The new &quot;oid&quot; form for defining
the attribute number should be used instead.
