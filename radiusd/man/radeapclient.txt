RADEAPCLIENT(1)		       FreeRADIUS Daemon	       RADEAPCLIENT(1)



NAME
       radeapclient - send EAP packets to a RADIUS server, calculate responses

SYNOPSIS
       radeapclient [-d raddb_directory] [-f file] [-i source_ip] [-xy] server
       {acct|auth} secret

DESCRIPTION
       radeapclient  is	 a radius client program. It can send arbitrary radius
       packets to a radius server, then shows the reply. Radeapclient  differs
       from  radclient	in that if there is an EAP-MD5 challenge, then it will
       be responded to.

       radeapclient is otherwise identical to radclient.

       The EAP-Identity attribute, if present is  used	to  construct  an  EAP
       Identity message.


       The EAP-MD5-Password attribute, if present is used to respond to an MD5
       challenge.

       No other EAP types are currently supported.


EXAMPLE
       A sample session that queries the remote server with an	EAP-MD5	 chal-
       lenge.

	      ( echo 'User-Name = "bob"';
		echo 'EAP-MD5-Password = "hello"';
		echo 'NAS-IP-Address = marajade.sandelman.ottawa.on.c';
		echo 'EAP-Code = Response';
		echo 'EAP-Id = 210';
		echo 'EAP-Type-Identity = "bob";
		echo 'Message-Authenticator = 0x00';
		echo 'NAS-Port = 0' ) >req.txt

	      radeapclient -x localhost auth testing123 <req.txt
