NAME
       radeapclient - send EAP packets to a RADIUS server, calculate responses

SYNOPSIS
       radeapclient [-4] [-6] [-c count] [-d raddb_directory] [-f  file]  [-h]
       [-i  source_ip] [-q] [-s] [-r retries] [-S file] [-t timeout] [-v] [-x]
       server {acct|auth} secret

DESCRIPTION
       radeapclient is a radius client program. It can send  arbitrary	radius
       packets	to a radius server, then shows the reply. Radeapclient differs
       from radclient in that if there is an EAP-MD5 challenge, then  it  will
       be responded to.

       radeapclient is otherwise identical to radclient.

       The  EAP-Identity  attribute,  if  present  is used to construct an EAP
       Identity message.


       The EAP-MD5-Password attribute, if present is used to respond to an MD5
       challenge.

       No other EAP types are currently supported.

       -t timeout
	      Wait  timeout  seconds  before retrying (may be a floating point

       -i id  Set request id to 'id'.  Values may be 0..255

EXAMPLE

       lenge.

	      ( echo 'User-Name = "bob"';
		echo 'EAP-MD5-Password = "hello"';
		echo 'NAS-IP-Address = marajade.sandelman.ottawa.on.c';
		echo 'EAP-Code = Response';
		echo 'EAP-Id = 210';
		echo 'EAP-Type-Identity = "bob";
		echo 'Message-Authenticator = 0x00';
