NAME
       rlm_realm - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The rlm_realm module parses the User-Name attribute into a User section
       and a Realm section.  This is used primarily in a proxy situation, how-
       ever, Realms can also be used locally to provide different service pro-
       files based on the Realm being used.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       format This can be either 'prefix' or 'suffix'.	It  specifies  whether
	      the  Realm  is before or after the User portion in the User-Name
	      string.

       delimiter
	      A single character in quotes, which is used  as  the  delimiting
	      character  that  separates  the  Realm  and User sections of the
	      string.

       ignore_default
	      This is set to either 'yes' or 'no'.  If set to 'yes', this will
	      prevent  the  module  instance from matching a realm against the
	      DEFAULT entry.  This may be useful if you  have  multiple  realm
	      module instances.  The default is 'no'.

       ignore_null
	      This is set to either 'yes' or 'no'.  If set to 'yes', this will
	      prevent the module instance from matching a  realm  against  the
	      NULL  entry.  This may be useful if you have multiple realm mod-
	      ule instances.  The default is 'no'.

       This module parses the realm from the User-Name attrbiute according  to
       the instance configuration, and then performs a lookup to find a match-
       ing realm in the '/etc/raddb/proxy.conf' file.  Depending on  the  con-
       figuration  of  the  Realm  as matched in the file, the username may be
       rewritten in a 'stripped' format, or with the  Realm  portion  removed.
       In either case, a Realm attribute is created and added to the packet on
       a match, which can be used by other modules.
