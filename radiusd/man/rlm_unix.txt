rlm_unix(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		   rlm_unix(5)



NAME
       rlm_unix - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_unix module allows authentication against the system password,
       shadow, and group files.  It also provides FreeRADIUS an interface into
       a  radwtmp  file  (used by "radlast") when added to the accounting sec-
       tion.

       The rlm_unix module provides the functionality for  "Auth-Type  =  Sys-
       tem",  rather  than  "Auth-Type = Unix".  The "System" name is used for
       historical reasons.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       cache  This is a 'yes' or 'no' option.  If set to yes, FreeRADIUS  will
	      read  the system files into memory, rather than perform a system
	      call to lookup the information.  On *BSD systems, you should set
	      this  value  to  no.  On other systems, if you have a very large
	      passwd and shadow files, you can try setting this to yes,  which
	      may increase the servers performance.  The default is no.

       cache_reload
	      This  is	the  number  of seconds to wait between refreshing the
	      cached files from the system.   It  has  no  effect  unless  you
	      enable caching.

       passwd The  path  to  the system passwd file.  Usually /etc/passwd.  If
	      commented out, or not set, the server will retrieve the informa-
	      tion via systemcalls.

       shadow The  path to the system shadow file.  Usually /etc/shadow.  This
	      is not set by default.

       group  The path to the system group file.  Usually /etc/group.  This is
	      not set by default.

       radwtmp
	      The  path  to  the  system  wtmp file to be used for keeping the
	      database of online users as read by the 'radlast' program.

       usegroup
	      This is a 'yes' or 'no' option.  If set to 'yes' this allows the
	      Group attribute to be used as a check item.  Default is 'no'.

CONFIGURATION
       modules {
	 ...
	 unix {
	   cache = no
	   cache_reload = 600
	   #passwd = /etc/passwd
	   #shadow = /etc/shadow
	   #group = /etc/group
	   usegroup = no
	   radwtmp = ${logdir}/radwtmp
	 }
	 ...
       }
