rlm_unix(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		   rlm_unix(5)



NAME
       rlm_unix - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_unix  module reads crypt(3) passwords from the system password
       file, and allows the server to use them for authentication.  The module
       also  provides  FreeRADIUS  an  interface  into a radwtmp file (used by
       "radlast") when added to the accounting section.

       The rlm_unix module does provides the functionality  for  "Auth-Type  =
       System".   The  module  should be listed in the "authenticate" section.
       Please see the default radiusd.conf shipped  with  the  server  for  an
       example of the correct usage of this module.

       As  of  FreeRADIUS  1.1.0,  the	module	no  longer  reads,  or	caches
       /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, or /etc/group.  If you wish  to  cache  those
       files,  see  rlm_passwd.   Most,  if not all, configurations should not
       need those files to be cached.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       radwtmp
	      The path to the system wtmp file to  be  used  for  keeping  the
	      database of online users as read by the 'radlast' program.

CONFIGURATION
	      modules {
		...
		unix {
		  radwtmp = ${logdir}/radwtmp
		}
		...
	      }
