       rlm_unix - FreeRADIUS Module

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _r_l_m___u_n_i_x module allows authentication against the system password,
       shadow, and group files.  It also provides FreeRADIUS an interface into
       a  radwtmp  file  (used by "radlast") when added to the accounting sec‐
       tion.

       The _r_l_m___u_n_i_x module provides the functionality for  "Auth-Type  =  Sys‐
       tem",  rather  than  "Auth-Type = Unix".  The "System" name is used for
       historical reasons.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       cache  This is a ’yes’ or ’no’ option.  If set to yes, FreeRADIUS  will
              read  the system files into memory, rather than perform a system
              call to lookup the information.  On *BSD systems, you should set
              this  value  to  no.  On other systems, if you have a very large
              passwd and shadow files, you can try setting this to yes,  which
              may increase the servers performance.  The default is no.

       cache_reload
              This  is  the  number  of seconds to wait between refreshing the
              cached files from the system.   It  has  no  effect  unless  you
              enable caching.

       passwd The  path  to  the system passwd file.  Usually /etc/passwd.  If
              commented out, or not set, the server will retrieve the informa‐
              tion via systemcalls.

       shadow The  path to the system shadow file.  Usually /etc/shadow.  This
              is not set by default.

       group  The path to the system group file.  Usually /etc/group.  This is
              not set by default.

       radwtmp
              The  path  to  the  system  wtmp file to be used for keeping the
              database of online users as read by the ’radlast’ program.

       usegroup
              This is a ’yes’ or ’no’ option.  If set to ’yes’ this allows the
              Group attribute to be used as a check item.  Default is ’no’.
