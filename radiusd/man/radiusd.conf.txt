radiusd.conf(5) 	 FreeRADIUS configuration file	       radiusd.conf(5)



NAME
       radiusd.conf - configuration file for the FreeRADIUS server

DESCRIPTION
       The  radiusd.conf  file	resides  in  the radius database directory, by
       default /etc/raddb.   It  defines  the  global  configuration  for  the
       FreeRADIUS server.


FILE FORMAT
       The file consists of attribute-value pairs, sections, and comments.

       Attribute-value pairs are of the form name = value.

       A  section  begins with a section name, followed on the same line by an
       open bracket {.	The section may contain other sections, or  attribute-
       value  pairs.   The  section  ends with a close bracket }, on a line by
       itself.

       Any line beginning with a (#)  is  deemed  to  be  a  comment,  and  is
       ignored.  Lines containing only whitespace are also ignored.

       The  file  is line-based.  That is, each newline-terminated line repre-
       sents either a comment, a section name, or an attribute-value pair.  It
       is  not	possible to specify multiple items on the same line, and there
       are no continuation lines.

       The value for a particular attribute may reference a previously defined
       attribute by name. The standard shell reference format ${name} is used.
       When the variable is in a section or subsection, it may	be  referenced
       as  ${section.subsection.name}.	 Forward  references  are not allowed.
       Relative references are allowed, via pre-pending the name with  one  or
       more of '.'.

       The  individidual  configuration  directives  are  too numerous to list
       here, so this manual page only documents the file format.  Please  read
       the  sample configuration file distributed with the server for comments
       describing each of the allowed configuration directives.


EXAMPLES
	    foo = bar

       Sets variable foo to have text value bar.

	    blogs = ${foo}

       Sets variable blogs to the value of variable foo from the current  sec-
       tion.   If  there  is  no  variable foo in the current section, then it
       looks for that variable in the body of  the  main  configuration  file,
       e.g. {Blogdir}

	    my_section {
		 baz = bud
	    }

       Defines a section named my_section, containing variable baz.

	    blogs = ${.foo}

       Sets variable blogs to the value of variable foo, from the current sec-
       tion.

	    blogs = ${..foo}

       Sets variable blogs to the value of  variable  foo,  from  the  section
       which contains the current section.

	    blogs = ${modules.detail.detailfile}

       Sets  variable blogs to the value of variable detailfile, of the detail
       module, which is in the modules section of the configuration file.
