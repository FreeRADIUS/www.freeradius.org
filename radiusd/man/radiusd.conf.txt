radiusd.conf(5) 	 FreeRADIUS configuration file	       radiusd.conf(5)



NAME
       radiusd.conf - configuration file for the FreeRADIUS server

DESCRIPTION
       The  radiusd.conf  file	resides  in  the radius database directory, by
       default /etc/raddb.   It  defines  the  global  configuration  for  the
       FreeRADIUS RADIUS server.

CONTENTS
       There  are  a  large number of configuration parameters for the server.
       Most are documented in the file itself as comments.   This  page  docu-
       ments  only  the format of the file.  Please read the radiusd.conf file
       itself for more information.

       The configuration file parser is independent of the  server  configura-
       tion.   This means that you can put almost anything into the configura-
       tion file.  So long as it is properly formatted, the server will start.

       When  the server parses the configuration file, it looks only for those
       configurations it understands.  Extra configuration items are  ignored.
       This "feature" can be (ab)used in certain interesting ways.

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  format  is  line-based,  like  many other Unix configuration
       files.  Each entry in the file must be placed  on  a  line  by  itself,
       although continuations are supported.

       The file consists of configuration items (variable = value pairs), sec-
       tions, and comments.

       Variables
	      Variables can be set via:


		   name = value


       Single and double-quoted strings are permitted:


		   string1 = "hello world"
		   string2 = 'hello mom'


       Sections
	      A section begins with a section name, followed on the same  line
	      by  an  open  bracket  '{'.  Section may contain other sections,
	      comments, or variables.  Sections may be nested  to  any	depth,
	      limited  only  by available memory.  A section ends with a close
	      bracket '}', on a line by itself.


		   section {
			...
		   }


       Sections can sometimes have a second name following the first one.  The
       situations where this is legal depend on the context.  See the examples
       and comments in the radiusd.conf file for more information.


		   section foo {
			...
		   }


       Comments
	      Any line beginning with a (#) is deemed to be a comment, and  is
	      ignored.	 Comments can appear after a variable or section defi-
	      nitions.


		   # comment
		   foo = bar # set variable 'foo' to value 'bar'
		   section { # start of section
		   ...
		   }	     # end of section


       Continuations
	      Long lines can be broken up via continuations, using '\' as  the
	      last character of the line.  For example, the following entry:


		   foo = "blah \
		   blah \
		   blah"


       will  set  the value of the variable "foo" to "blah blah blah".	Any CR
       or LF is not turned into a space, but all other whitespace is preserved
       in the final value.

REFERENCES
       The  value  of a variable can reference another variable.  These refer-
       ences are evaluated when the configuration file is loaded, which  means
       that  there  is no run-time cost associated with them.  This feature is
       most useful for turning long, repeated pieces of text into short  ones.

       Variables are referenced by ${variable_name}, as in the following exam-
       ples.


		   foo = bar	   # set variable 'foo' to value 'bar'
		   who = ${foo}    # sets variable 'who' to value of variable 'foo'
		   my = "${foo} a" # sets variable 'my' to "bar a"


       If the variable exists in a section or subsection, it can be referenced
       as ${section.subsection.variable}.  Forward references are not allowed.
       Relative references are allowed, by pre-pending the name  with  one  or
       more period.


		   blogs = ${.foo}


       Will  set variable blogs to the value of variable foo, from the current
       section.


		   blogs = ${..foo}


       Will set variable blogs to the value of variable foo, from the  section
       which contains the current section.


		   blogs = ${modules.detail.detailfile}


       Will  set  variable  blogs  to the value of variable detailfile, of the
       detail module, which is in the modules  section	of  the  configuration
       file.
