            <h1>Enterprise Wi-Fi / IEEE 802.1X</h1>
            <h2>Deficiencies of PSK networks</h2>
            <p>Common home-use Wi-Fi networks do not need a RADIUS server because
                they “secure” the network with <strong>one single network key</strong>, the 
                “WPA/WPA2 Pre-Shared Key” (PSK). That key is the same for every user, 
                is often guessable, and <strong>can’t be revoked for one user</strong> (if one user should be 
                denied access, the key needs to be changed for the entire network
                and every user needs to be given the new key). When a network is
                sniffed, an attacker can perform <strong>offline attacks</strong> to guess the key.</p>
            <p><strong>All this makes PSK networks unfit for enterprise use.</strong></p>
            <h2>IEEE 802.1X and RADIUS Authentication</h2>
            <p>The IEEE standards for Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) foresee an “Enterprise”
                mode which is fundamentally different from PSK networks because
                the Wi-Fi encryption keys are provisioned <strong>per user</strong>
                and <strong>per session</strong>. Every user needs to authenticate
                with his <strong>personal credentials</strong>; at that moment a 
                key is generated and is communicated to the user’s device and the
                NAS he connects to.</p>
            <p>Before users send their authentication credentials,
                the <strong>network must authenticate to the user</strong>, proving
                that it is indeed genuine; only then is the client’s credential
                released. The IEEE standard IEEE 802.1X (using RADIUS and the
                Extensible Authentication Protocol, EAP) is used for authentication
                and key management.</p>
            <p>Enterprise Wi-Fi authentication also enables advanced features
                such as putting users dynamically into a specific VLAN (e.g. 
                separate guest and staff logins into different IP networks
                even though being on the same SSID).</p>
            <p>Enterprise Wi-Fi requires</p>
            <ol>
                <li>a RADIUS server which can do EAP authentication</li>
                <li>Wi-Fi equipment which is correctly configured to use RADIUS authentication</li>
                <li>user devices configured to do Enterprise Wi-Fi correctly</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>RADIUS Server</h2>
            <p>The central component in an IEEE 802.1X / Enterprise Wi-Fi environment
            is the RADIUS server: it receives RADIUS packets from the Wi-Fi Access
            Point / Controller (see below), processes those by either proxying it
            to another server (in a roaming environment) or by processing the
            packet and authenticating the user itself.</p>
            <p>
            To authenticate the user, the RADIUS server extracts the EAP
            authentication data from the EAP-Message attribute of the RADIUS
            packet and acts on the contents: it takes the role of an EAP server.</p>
            <p>EAP authentication typically involves establishing a TLS tunnel
            with a server certificate (i.e. authenticating the server to the user)
            and then exchanging user credentials (i.e. the user authenticating to
            the server). After the authentication with EAP, the RADIUS server adds
            VLAN assignment attributes and other authorisation data, and sends
            those in the final RADIUS packet.</p>
            <p>
            FreeRADIUS excels not only at RADIUS, but also in its role as EAP 
            server. It supports a wide variety of EAP authentication methods and
            allows sending additional authorisation data. It supports RADIUS
            proxying of EAP authentication traffic and thus enables roaming; 
            and it supports altering authorisation parameters after the initial
            authentication has taken place (CoA).
            </p>
            <h2>Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>The access point / Wi-Fi controller needs to be capable of the WPA2 Enterprise
                operation mode; configuration options in the device are often
                called IEEE 802.1X Authentication, RADIUS or WPA Enterprise.
                In this operation mode, the device becomes a NAS (i.e. RADIUS
                client), so needs to be configured with the IP address of the
                RADIUS server to connect to and the corresponding shared secret
                for the RADIUS communication as configured on the RADIUS server.</p>
            <p>The aforementioned per-user VLAN assignment is not part of IEEE 
                802.1X; it is an extra feature which the Wi-Fi access point or
                controller may support or not, despite its RADIUS capability. If
                you are provisioning devices and find this feature valuable, you
                should look for features called “Dynamic VLAN Assignment” “VLAN
                Override” or similar. To make use of the feature, the last RADIUS
                packet sent from the RADIUS Server to the Access Point, the 
                Access-Accept packet, needs to include VLAN assignment attributes.</p>
            <h2>User Device Configuration</h2>
            <p>After having completed the RADIUS server and Wi-Fi equipment
                setup, it is <i>possible</i> for users to authenticate
                securely to the network and to verify that they are not
                connected to an attacker network (“evil twin”).</p>
            <p>For this possibility to actually happen, the network operator
                needs to communicate the pertinent RADIUS server settings to all end
                users, and he needs to ensure that the end users transform
                these server-side settings into a proper client-side
                configuration.</p>
            <p>This typically involves to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>import or mark as trusted the CA certificate to validate the RADIUS server’s certificate</li>
                <li>configure the expected server name of the server certificate</li>
                <li>select an EAP type on the client device which matches one of the configured EAP types on the server</li>
                <li>optionally enable extra features such as enhanced privacy protection (use of anonymous outer identities) etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Network administrators should be aware that neglecting to 
                secure the client-side setup puts the security of the
                enterprise network at risk - badly configured user devices
                can be tricked to connect to a rogue AP / evil twin network! 
                Such an attacher network can learn their credentials as they 
                authenticate - and the attacker can from then on log into the
                genuine network with those same credentials.
                The attacker can also inspect their payload - with the false
                feeling of being connected to the own enterprise network,
                some users or their applications may use unencrypted
                communication where they should not.</p>
            <p>Manual setup instructions in e.g. PDF “click here and there”
                instructions have proven to be error-prone, time-consuming
                and typically trigger significant helpdesk activity.</p>
            <p>There are automatic deployment tools for various platforms on
                the market; e.g the “Apple Configurator” application can
                produce configuration files for iOS devices and Mac OS
                computers.</p>
            <p>There are also web services which cater for a variety of
                platforms at the same time. Many of those are commercial,
                but some provide their services for free or freemium. One 
                such example is the 
                <a href="https://802.1x-config.org">Enterprise Network Configuration Assistant Tool (CAT)</a>
                at 
                <a href="https://802.1x-config.org">https://802.1x-config.org</a> - all
                basic end-user device provisioning functionality on all
                supported platforms (Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Linux) is free;
                extra features such as custom branding or digitally signed
                installation programs are a paid-for extra.
