rlm_idn(5)		       FreeRADIUS Module		    rlm_idn(5)



NAME
       rlm_idn - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       When  instantiated,  the rlm_idn module provides an xlat for performing
       IDNA encoding of internationalized domain names.   Decoding  and  other
       similar encodings like plain punycode are not currently supported.

       For example, the following unlang expression would evaluate to TRUE:

       "%{idn:fA<<bar.site}" == "xn--fbar-v7a.site"


       Each instance of rlm_idn may take the following parameters:

       use_std3_ascii_rules
	      This boolean is set by default and prohibits e.g. underscores in
	      domain names.

       allow_unassigned
	      This boolean is unset by default, which prohibits use  of  unas-
	      signed Unicode points.
