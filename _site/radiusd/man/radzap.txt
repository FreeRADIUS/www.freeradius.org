RADZAP(1)		       FreeRadius Daemon		     RADZAP(1)



NAME
       radzap - remove rogue entries from the active sessions database

SYNOPSIS
       radzap  [-d  raddb_directory]  [-r  radius_server] [-p accounting_port]
       [-v] nas [port] [username]

DESCRIPTION
       The FreeRadius server can be configured to maintain an  active  session
       database  in  a	file  called radutmp. Commands like radwho(1) use this
       database. Sometimes that database can get out  of  sync,  and  then  it
       might contain rogue entries. radzap can clean up this database.

OPTIONS
       -d raddb_directory
	      The directory that contains the RADIUS configuration files.

       -r radius_server
	      Host name or IP address of the RADIUS server.

       -p accounting_port
	      The  port  to which accounting packets are sent.	See "/etc/ser-
	      vices", port "radacct" for the default on your  system  (usually
	      1646 or 1813).

       -v     Verbose. Shows you what it is doing.

       nas    Hostname	or IP address of the NAS (Network Access Server, some-
	      times called "terminal server")  of  the	session  you  want  to
	      remove.

       port   Port  of	the  session  you want to remove. This is the NAS-Port
	      radius attribute, it doesn't have anything to do with  UDP  port
	      numbers.	Must be an integer. -1 means "any", and is the default
	      if this option is not specified.

       username
	      Optional: the username of the session you want to remove.
