NAME
       dhcpclient  - Send a DHCP request with provided DHCP attributes and get
       the output response.

SYNOPSIS
       dhcpclient [-d raddb_directory]	[-D  dictionary_directory]  [-f  file]
       [-h]   [-i  interface]  [-t  timeout]  [-v]  [-x]  server[:port]  {dis-
       cover|request|decline|release|inform|lease_query|auto}

DESCRIPTION
       dhcpclient is a DHCP test client program. It can  send  arbitrary  DHCP
       packets to the FreeRADIUS server running as DHCP server, then shows the
       reply.  It can be used to test changes you made in the configuration of
       the DHCP server, or it can be used to monitor if a DHCP server is up.

       dhcpclient reads DHCP attribute/value pairs from its standard input, or
       from a file specified on  the  command  line.  It  then	encodes  these
       attribute/value	pairs  using  the  dictionary,	and  sends them to the
       local/remote server.

OPTIONS
       -d raddb_directory
	      The directory that contains the user dictionary  file.  Defaults
	      to /etc/raddb.

       -D dictionary_directory
	      The  directory  that contains the main dictionary file. Defaults
	      to /usr/share/freeradius.

       -f file
	      File to read the attribute/value pairs  from.  If  this  is  not
	      specified, they are read from stdin.

       -h     Print usage help information.

       -i interface
	      Select  which interface to send/receive at packet level on a raw
	      socket.

       -t timeout
	      Wait timeout seconds  before  deciding  that  the  NAS  has  not
	      responded to a request, and re-sending the packet. This may be a
	      floating point number, e.g. 2.2.

       -v     Print out program version information.

       -x     Print out debugging information.

       server[:port]
	      The hostname or IP address of the remote	server.  Optionally  a
	      UDP  port  can  be specified. If no UDP port is specified, 67 is
	      used.

       discover | request | decline | release | inform | lease_query | auto
	      DHCP Message Type - use the type relevant for testing.  If  auto
	      then the message type has to be provided in attribute/value pair
	      DHCP-Message-Type.
