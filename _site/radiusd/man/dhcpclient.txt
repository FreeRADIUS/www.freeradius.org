NAME
       dhcpclient  -  Send  a DHCP request with provided RADIUS attributes and
       get the output response.

SYNOPSIS
       dhcpclient [-d raddb_directory]	[-D  dictionary_directory]  [-f  file]
       [-h]   [-i  interface]  [-t  timeout]  [-v]  [-x]  server[:port]  {dis-
       cover|request|decline|release|inform|auto}

DESCRIPTION
       dhcpclient is a DHCP test client program. It can  send  arbitrary  DHCP
       packets to the FreeRADIUS server running as DHCP server, then shows the
       reply.  It can be used to test changes you made in the configuration of
       the  radius  server, or it can be used to monitor if a radius server is
       up.

       dhcpclient reads radius attribute/value pairs from its standard	input,
       or  from  a  file  specified on the command line. It then encodes these
       attribute/value pairs using the	dictionary,  and  sends  them  to  the
       local/remote server.

OPTIONS
       -d raddb_directory
	      The  directory  that contains the user dictionary file. Defaults
	      to /etc/raddb.

       -D dictionary_directory
	      The directory that contains the main dictionary  file.  Defaults
	      to /usr/share/freeradius.

       -f file[:file]
	      File  to	read  the  attribute/value  pairs from. If this is not
	      specified, they are read from stdin.  This option can be	speci-
	      fied  multiple times, in which case packets are sent in order by
	      file, and within each file, by first packet to last  packet.   A
	      blank line separates logical packets within a file.

       -h     Print usage help information.

       -i interface
	      Select  which interface to send/receive at packet level on a raw
	      socket.

       -t timeout
	      Wait timeout seconds  before  deciding  that  the  NAS  has  not
	      responded to a request, and re-sending the packet. This may be a
	      floating point number, e.g. 2.2.

       -v     Print out program version information.

       -x     Print out debugging information.

       server[:port]
	      The hostname or IP address of the remote	server.  Optionally  a
	      UDP  port  can  be specified. If no UDP port is specified, it is
	      looked up in /etc/services.  The	service  name  looked  for  is
	      radacct  for  accounting	packets,  and  radius  for  all  other
	      requests. If a service is not found in /etc/services,  1813  and
	      1812 are used respectively.
