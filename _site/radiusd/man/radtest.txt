RADTEST(1)		       FreeRADIUS Daemon		    RADTEST(1)



NAME
       radtest - send packets to a RADIUS server, show reply

SYNOPSIS
       radtest	[-d raddb_directory] user password radius-server nas-port-num-
       ber secret [ppphint] [nasname]

DESCRIPTION
       radtest	is  a  frontend  to  radclient(1).  It	generates  a  list  of
       attribute/value	pairs  based  on the command line arguments, and feeds
       these into radclient. It's a fast and convenient way to test  a	radius
       server.


OPTIONS
       -d raddb_directory
	      The   directory  that  contains  the  RADIUS  dictionary	files.
	      Defaults to /etc/raddb.


       user   Username to send.


       password
	      Password of the user.


       radius-server
	      Hostname or IP address of the radius server. Optionally, you may
	      specify a port by appending :port


       nas-port-number
	      The value of the NAS-Port attribute. Is an integer between 0 and
	      2^31, and it really doesn't matter what you put here. 10 will do
	      fine.


       secret The shared secret for this client.


       ppphint
	      If  you put an integer > 0 here, radtest (or actually radclient)
	      will add the attribute Framed-Protocol  =  PPP  to  the  request
	      packet.


       nasname
	      If  present, this will be resolved to an IP address and added to
	      the request packet as the NAS-IP-Address attribute. If you don't
	      specify it, the local hostname of the system will be used.
