ACCT_USERS(5)		FreeRADIUS user accounting file 	 ACCT_USERS(5)



NAME
       acct_users - user accounting file for the FreeRADIUS server

DESCRIPTION
       The  acct_users	file  resides  in  the	radius	database directory, by
       default /etc/raddb.  It contains a series of  configuration  directives
       which are used by the files module to decide how to log accounting mes-
       sages.

       The format of this file is identical to that of the users file,	except
       that  it  controls the response to accounting requests, not authentica-
       tion requests.


FILES
