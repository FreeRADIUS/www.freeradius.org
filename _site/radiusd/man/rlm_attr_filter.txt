rlm_attr_filter(5)	       FreeRADIUS Module	    rlm_attr_filter(5)



NAME
       rlm_attr_filter - FreeRADIUS Module

DESCRIPTION
       The  rlm_attr_filter module exists for filtering certain attributes and
       values in received ( or transmitted ) radius packets from  (  or  to  )
       remote proxy servers.  It gives the proxier ( us ) a flexible framework
       to filter the attributes we send to or receive from these remote  prox-
       ies.  This makes sense, for example, in an out-sourced dialup situation
       to various policy decisions, such as restricting a  client  to  certain
       ranges of Idle-Timeout or Session-Timeout.

       Filter  rules  are  defined and applied on a per-realm basis, where the
       realm is anything that is defined and matched based on  the  configura-
       tion of the rlm_realm module.

       The  file  that defines the attribute filtering rules follows a similar
       syntax to the users file.  There are a few differences however:

	   There are no check-items allowed other than the realm.

	   There can only be a single DEFAULT entry.

       The rules for each entry are parsed to top to bottom, and an  attribute
       must  pass *all* the rules which affect it in order to make it past the
       filter.	Order of the rules is important.  The operators and their pur-
       pose in defining the rules are as follows:

       =      THIS  OPERATOR  IS NOT ALLOWED.  If used, and warning message is
	      printed and it is treated as ==

       :=     Set, this attribute and value will always be placed in the  out-
	      put A/V Pairs.  If the attribute exists, it is overwritten.

       ==     Equal, value must match exactly.

       =*     Always Equal, allow all values for the specified attribute.

       !*     Never Equal, disallow all values for the specified attribute.  (
	      This is redundant, as any A/V Pair not explicitly permitted will
	      be dropped ).

       !=     Not Equal, value must not match.

       >=     Greater Than or Equal

       <=     Less Than or Equal

       >      Greather Than

       <      Less Than

       If  regular  expressions  are  enabled the following operators are also
       possible.  ( Regular Expressions are included by  default  unless  your
       system  doesn't	support them, which should be rare ).  The value field
       uses standard regular expression syntax.

       =~     Regular Expression Equal

       !~     Regular Expression Not Equal

       See the default /etc/raddb/attrs for working examples  of  sample  rule
       ordering and how to use the different operators.

       The main configuration item is:

       attrsfile
	      This  specifies the location of the file used to load the filter
	      rules.
