     2.  Abstract

     This  document  defines  dynamic  attributes used by the Remote Access
     Dialin User Service  (RADIUS).  These  attributes  are  written  to  a
     dynamic  directory  service  by  the RADIUS server in order to provide
     information about sessions in progress. This information can  then  be
     used  in  order  to provide for control of simultaneous logins, or for
     detection or tracking of security incidents in progress.


     3.  Introduction

     The RADIUS protocol, described in  [6]-[9],  supports  authentication,
     authorization  and  accounting  for  dialup  users.   To  date, RADIUS
     servers have retrieved their configuration from user databases  and/or
     flat  configuration  files.  In  order  to  consolidate stores of user
     information, it is desirable to integrate a RADIUS with an  LDAP-based
     directory service.

     This  document  is  one of three related specifications which describe
     how a RADIUS server may be integrated  with  an  LDAP-based  directory
     service.  Reference  [14] specifies how user data utilized by a RADIUS



     Aboba                                                         [Page 1]

     server may be stored in an  LDAP-based  directory  service.  Reference
     [15]  describes  how user credentials submitted during PPP authentica-
     tion and sent by the NAS in the RADIUS Access-Request may be validated
     by the RADIUS server.

     This document describes how a dynamic directory service may be used to
     store these and other attributes relating  to  sessions  in  progress.
     Such  information  can  be  useful for a variety of purposes including
     security incident response; simultaneous usage control; or  monitoring
     of connection quality, login time, packet size or bandwidth usage. Due
     to the frequency of changes to this data, dynamic attributes  must  be
     employed, as described in [5] and [10].

     Attributes  useful  for  this purpose include attributes from both the
     Access-Request and Access-Reply. For example, attributes such as  Nas-
     IP-Address,  Nas-Port, Nas-Identifier, Called-Station-Id, Calling-Sta-
     tion-Id, and Connect-Info are available from the RADIUS Access-Request
     packet.  Other  attributes  such  as Framed-IP-Address may be computed
     dynamically, and sent in the RADIUS Access-Accept  packet.  Attributes
     relating to a user's resource consumption during a session in progress
     are  made  available  via  the  Interim  Accounting  Record  Extension
     described in [9]. These include Acct-Input-Octets, Acct-Output-Octets,
     Acct-Session-Id, Acct-Authentic,  Acct-Session-Time,  Acct-Input-Pack-
     ets, Acct-Output-Packets, Acct-Terminate-Cause, Acct-Multi-Session-Id,
     Acct-Link-Count, Acct-Tunnel-Client-Endpoint,  and  Act-Tunnel-Connec-
     tion-Id.

     Typically  it  is expected that the RADIUS server will create an entry
     in the dynamic directory service after  a  successful  authentication,
     and will delete the entry when the user logs off. However, some imple-
     mentations may find it  desirable  to  allow  persistence  of  entries
     relating  to failed authentications or logged off users. In this case,
     a refresh interval is typically set (for example, 24  hours)  so  that
     the entries will timeout after an appropriate interval.


     3.1.  Example

     Let us assume that BIGCO wishes to offer dialin access to their domes-
     tic sales force, as well as VPN  access  to  contractors  and  finance
     employees  travelling  overseas.  In  order to consistently manage and
     account for the use of their NAS devices and Layer  2  tunnel  servers
     (PPTP/L2F/L2TP), BIGCO has chosen to adopt the RADIUS protocol.

     As  part of this service offering, BIGCO may wish to restrict contrac-
     tors and finance employees to a single login at a time.  In  order  to
     implement  this policy, it is necessary for the BIGCO RADIUS server to
     be able to retrieve the number of sessions in progress for a  particu-
     lar user.

     BIGCO  may  also wish to implement auditing and alarming policies. For
     example, BIGCO may wish to set an alarm when contractors remain conti-
     nously  logged  on  for more than a certain amount of time, attempt to
     access the network from more  than  one  location  simultaneously,  or



     Aboba                                                         [Page 2]

     transfer  more  than  a threshold number of octets during a given time
     period. It may also be desirable to set a threshold on failed  authen-
     tications  during a given time period, in order to detect break-ins in
     progress.

     If an alarm is triggered, it may be desirable to have  access  to  the
     Nas-IP-Address, Nas-Port, Called-Station-Id and Calling-Station-Id for
     the failed login attempt or session in progress so that the  call  may
     be traced.

     ing objects:
