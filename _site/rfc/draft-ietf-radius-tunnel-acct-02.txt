2.  Abstract

This document defines new RADIUS accounting Attributes  and  new  values
for  the existing Acct-Status-Type Attribute [1] designed to support the
provision of compulsory tunneling in dial-up networks.


3.  Motivation

Many applications of tunneling protocols such as PPTP and  L2TP  involve
dial-up network access.  Some, such as the provision of secure access to
corporate intranets via the Internet,  are  characterized  by  voluntary

INTERNET-DRAFT      RADIUS Accounting Tunnel Support      September 1998


tunneling:  the  tunnel is created at the request of the user for a spe-
cific purpose.  Other applications  involve  compulsory  tunneling:  the
tunnel  is created without any action from the user and without allowing
the user any choice in the matter.  Examples of applications that  might
be  implemented  using  compulsory tunnels are Internet software upgrade
servers, software registration servers and banking services.  These  are
all services which, without compulsory tunneling, would probably be pro-
vided using dedicated networks or  at  least  dedicated  network  access
servers  (NAS),  since  they are characterized by the need to limit user
access to specific hosts.  Given the existence of widespread support for
compulsory tunneling, however, these types of services could be accessed
via any Internet service provider (ISP).  Typically,  ISPs  providing  a
service  want  to collect data regarding that service, for billing, net-
work planning, etc.  The most popular way to collect usage data in dial-
up  networks today is by means of RADIUS  Accounting.  The use of RADIUS
Accounting allows dial-up usage data to be collected at a central  loca-
tion,  rather  than  stored  on  each NAS.  It makes sense to use RADIUS
Accounting to collect  usage  data  regarding  tunneling,  since  RADIUS
Accounting  has  been  widely implemented and was designed to carry this
type of information.  In order to provide this functionality, new RADIUS
attributes are needed to aid in the collation of tunnel usage data; this
document defines these attributes.  In addition, several new values  for
the  Acct-Status-Type  attribute are proposed.  Specific recommendations
for, and examples of, the application of this attribute for the L2TP and
PPTP protocols can be found in draft-ietf-radius-tunnel-imp-XX.txt.


4.  Specification of Requirements

In  this  document,  the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
"recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT",  are  to  be  interpreted  as
described in [2].

      session.   It  SHOULD  be  included  in Accounting-Request packets
      which contain  an  Acct-Status-Type  attribute  having  the  value
      Start, Stop or any of the values described above.  This attribute,
      along with the Tunnel-Client-Endpoint  and  Tunnel-Server-Endpoint
      attributes  [3],  may be used to provide a means to uniquely iden-
      tify a tunnel session for auditing purposes.

   A summary of the Acct-Tunnel-Connection  Attribute  format  is  shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

   |      Type     |    Length     |    String ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      68 for Acct-Tunnel-Connection


   Length

      >= 3


   String

      The  format  of  the  identifier  represented  by the String field
      depends upon the value of  the  Tunnel-Type  attribute  [3].   For
      example,  to  fully  identify  an L2TP tunnel connection, the L2TP
      Tunnel ID and Call ID might be encoded in this field.   The  exact
      encoding of this field is implementation dependent.


6.2.  Acct-Tunnel-Packets-Lost

   Description

      This  Attribute  indicates  the  number of packets lost on a given
      link.  It SHOULD be included in Accounting-Request  packets  which
      contain  an  Acct-Status-Type  attribute  having the value Tunnel-
      Link-Stop.

   A summary of the Acct-Tunnel-Packets-Lost Attribute format  is  shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2                   3

      The  Lost field is 4 octets in length and represents the number of
      packets lost on the link.


7.  Table of Attributes

The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found in
Accounting-Request  packets.   No  tunnel  attributes should be found in
Accounting-Response packets.

   Request        #       Attribute
     0-1          64      Tunnel-Type
     0-1          65      Tunnel-Medium-Type
     0-1          66      Tunnel-Client-Endpoint
     0-1          67      Tunnel-Server-Endpoint
     0-1          68      Acct-Tunnel-Connection
     0            69      Tunnel-Password
     0-1          81      Tunnel-Private-Group-ID
     0-1          82      Tunnel-Assignment-ID
     0            83      Tunnel-Preference
     0-1          ??      Acct-Tunnel-Packets-Lost

The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.
   0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.
   0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in packet.

8.  Security Considerations

By "sniffing" RADIUS Accounting packets, it might  be  possible  for  an
eavesdropper to perform a passive analysis of tunnel connections.
