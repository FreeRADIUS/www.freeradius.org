INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Key Attribute           16 January 2002


1.  Introduction

This document specifies the RADIUS Master-Session-Key attribute, an
attribute from which keys can be derived for a wide variety of
ciphersuites, including those used with PPP [RFC1661] and IEEE 802.11
[IEEE80211].

The Master-Session-Key attribute can be used to key a wide variety of
ciphersuites, and is compatible with any EAP method. As a result, it
avoids the proliferation of EAP method-specific master session key
algorithms, as well as ciphersuite-specific transient session key
algorithms.

This is accomplished by the adoption of two separate algorithms:

[1]  An algorithm for the derivation of "master session keys" from the
     negotiated master secret.  The "master session keys" are derived
     from the master secret derived by the EAP method, but are never
     directly used by ciphersuites; they are only used in the derivation
     of transient session keys.  These "master session keys" are derived
     on the client and the backend authentication server. The backend
     authentication server then transmits the "master session keys" to
     the NAS.  The algorithm by which the master session keys are
     derived from a master secret is described in section 3.5 of
     [RFC2716].

[2]  An algorithm for the derivation of "transient session keys" from
     the "master session keys". The "transient session keys" are used
     for encryption, authentication and IV-generation in each direction,
     and are derived by the NAS and client, based on the negotiated
     ciphersuite. Examples of such algorithms are provided in section 4
     of [RFC3079].

1.1.  Requirements language

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT",  "optional",
"recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC2119].

2.  Attributes

2.1.  Master-Session-Key

Description

This Attribute indicates master session key material used to derive
ciphersuite-specific keys. This Attribute MAY only be present in an
Access-Accept packet.

Length

Salt
   The Salt field is two octets in length and is used to ensure the
   uniqueness of the keys used to encrypt each of the encrypted
   attributes occurring in a given Access-Accept packet.  The most
   significant bit (leftmost) of the Salt field MUST be set (1).  The
   contents of each Salt field in a given Access-Accept packet MUST be
   unique.

String

   The plaintext String field is 192 octets in length and consists of 6
   logical subfields, each of which are 32 octets in length:

INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Key Attribute           16 January 2002


   Here PAEncKey is the peer to authenticator encryption key; APEncKey
   is the authenticator to peer encryption key; PAAuthKey is the peer to
   authenticator authentication key; APAuthkey is the authenticator to
   peer authentication key; PAIV is the peer to authenticator
   initialization vector; and APIV the authenticator to peer
   initialization vector. Further description is available in section
   3.5 of [RFC2716].

   The String field MUST be encrypted as follows, prior to transmission:

[1] Construct a plaintext version of the String field by concatenating
    PAEncKey, APEncKey, PAAuthKey, APAuthKey, PAIV and APIV fields.
    Call this plaintext P.

[2] Call the shared secret S, the pseudo-random 128-bit Request
    Authenticator (from the corresponding Access-Request packet) R, and
    the contents of the Salt field A.  Break P into 16 octet chunks
    p(1), p(2)...p(i), where i = len(P)/16.  Call the ciphertext blocks
    c(1), c(2)...c(i) and the final ciphertext C.  Intermediate values
    b(1), b(2)...c(i) are required.  Encryption is performed in the
    following manner ('+' indicates concatenation):

    b(1) = HMAC-MD5(S + R + A)    c(1) = p(1) xor b(1)   C = c(1)

    b(2) = HMAC-MD5(S + c(1))     c(2) = p(2) xor b(2)   C = C + c(2)

                      .                      .

                      .                      .

    b(i) = HMAC-MD5(S + c(i-1))   c(i) = p(i) xor b(i)   C = C + c(i)

    The   resulting   encrypted   String   field    will    contain
    c(1)+c(2)+...+c(i).

[3] On receipt, the process is reversed to yield the plaintext String.

    Implementation Notes

    It is possible that the length of the key returned may be larger
    than needed for the encryption scheme in use.  In this case, the
    RADIUS client is responsible for performing any necessary
    truncation. The truncation process is described in [SESS].

    This attribute MAY be used to pass a key from an external (e.g., EAP
    [RFC2284]) server to the RADIUS server.  In this case, it may be
    impossible for the external server to correctly encrypt the key,
    since the RADIUS shared secret might be unavailable.  The external

INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Key Attribute           16 January 2002


    server SHOULD, however, return the attribute as defined above; the
    Salt field SHOULD be zero-filled.  When the RADIUS server receives
    the attribute from the external server, it MUST correctly set the
    Salt field and encrypt the String field before transmitting it to
    the RADIUS client.  If the channel used is not secure from
    eavesdropping, the attribute MUST be  cryptographically protected.

3.  Table of Attributes

The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found in
which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Request   Accept   Reject   Challenge  Accounting #    Attribute
                                          Request
   0         0-1      0        0          0         TBD   Master-Session-Key
   Request   Accept   Reject   Challenge             #    Attribute

4.  Security Considerations

This specification utilizes an attribute-hiding mechanism similar to
that originally introduced in [RFC2865].  As noted in [RFC2865], there
are known weaknesses in this algorithm, some of which are noted in
[MD5Attack]. Since the algorithm involves use of a stream cipher for
RADIUS attribute hiding, the security of the scheme depends on the
global and temporal uniqueness of the Request Authenticator from which
the key stream is determined.  If the Request Authenticator is repeated
on any NAS using the same RADIUS shared secret, then the key stream
corresponding to that Request Authenticator should be considered
compromised.

In an attempt to add additional protection, the algorithm was extended
with a salt in [RFC2868] and [RFC2548]. Unfortunately those documents
continued to use MD5 [RFC1321] as opposed to HMAC-MD5. Therefore no
additional protection was conferred by the salt, since it is passed in
the clear, and if the original key stream were to be compromised, then
the attacker could immediately calculate the salt-modified keystream
from it.

It should also be noted that the RADIUS Response Authenticator and
Message-Authenticator attributes are vulnerable to dictionary attack, so
that if the RADIUS shared secret is chosen carelessly or used on many
NASen, then it can be compromised, in which case the attribute hiding
scheme described in this specification has no value.

These deficiencies can be remedied by running RADIUS over IPsec ESP with
a non-null transform, as described in [RFC3162].

INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Key Attribute           16 January 2002


Note also that RADIUS provides no protection against rogue proxies.
Since RADIUS proxies will decrypt and re-encrypt the key field for
forwarding, this attribute SHOULD NOT be used on networks where
untrusted RADIUS proxies reside.

5.  IANA Considerations

This draft requires the assignment of a new RADIUS attribute number for
the Master-Session-Key attribute.
