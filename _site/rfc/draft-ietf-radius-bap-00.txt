2.  Abstract

This  document  describes  a  set  of  vendor-specific RADIUS attributes
designed to support the dynamic control of bandwidth allocation in  mul-
tilink  PPP [1].  Attributes are defined that specify whether use of the
PPP Bandwidth Allocation Protocol [2] is allowed or required on incoming
calls,  the  level  of  line  capacity (expressed as a percentage) below
which utilization must fall before a link is eligible to be dropped, and
the length of time (in seconds) that a link must be underutilized before
it is dropped.

3.  Specification of Requirements

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT",  "optional",
"recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT"  are  to be interpreted as
described in [3].


4.  Attributes

The following sections describe sub-attributes which may be  transmitted
in one or more RADIUS attributes of type Vendor-Specific [4].  More than
one  sub-attribute  MAY  be  transmitted  in  a  single  Vendor-Specific
Attribute;  if  this  is  done, the sub-attributes SHOULD be packed as a
sequence of Vendor-Type/Vendor-Length/Value triples following the inital
Type,  Length and Vendor-ID fields.  The Length field of the Vendor-Spe-
cific Attribute MUST be set equal to the sum of the Vendor-Length fields
of  the  sub-attributes contained in the Vendor-Specific Attribute, plus
six.  The Vendor-ID field of the Vendor-Specific  Attribute(s)  MUST  be
set to decimal 311 (Microsoft).


4.1.  BAP-Usage

   Description

      This  Attribute describes whether th use of BAP is allowed, disal-
      lowed or required on new multilink  calls.   It  MAY  be  used  in
      Access-Accept packets.

   A  summary  of  the  BAP-Usage  Attribute format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Vendor-Type
      13 for BAP-Usage.

   Vendor-Length

   Value
      The Value field is four octets.

         0      BAP usage not allowed
         1      BAP usage allowed
         2      BAP usage required


4.2.  Link-Utilization-Threshold

   Description

      This Attribute represents the percentage  of  available  bandwidth
      utilization below which the link must fall before the link is eli-
      gible for termination.  Permissible values for  the  Link-Utiliza-
      tion-Threshold Attribute are in the range 1-100, inclusive.  It is
      only used in Access-Accept packets.

   A summary of the Link-Utilization-Threshold Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
              Value (cont)         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Vendor-Type
      14 for Link-Utilization-Threshold

   Vendor-Length
      6

   Value
      The  Value  field is four octets in length and represents the per-
      centage of available bandwidth utilization below  which  the  link
      must  fall before the link is eligible for termination.  Permissi-
      ble values are in the range 1-100, inclusive.


4.3.  Link-Drop-Time-Limit

   Description

      The Link-Drop-Time-Limit Attribute indicates the  length  of  time
      (in  seconds)  that  a  link  must  be  underutilized before it is
      dropped.  It MAY only be included in Access-Accept packets.

   A summary of  the  Link-Drop-Time-Limit  Attribute  format  is  given



Zorn                                                            [Page 3]

   Vendor-Type
      15 for Link-Drop-Time-Limit

   Vendor-Length
      6

   Value
      The  Value field represents the number of seconds that a link must
      be underutilized (i.e., display bandwidth  utilization  below  the
      threshold  specified  in the Link-Utilization-Threshold Attribute)
      before the link is dropped.


5.  Table of Attributes

   0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.
   0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in packet.


6.  Security Considerations
