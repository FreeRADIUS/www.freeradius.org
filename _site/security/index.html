                            <p>We requested that Guido Vranken do fuzz testing against the
server. He found issues in all versions of the server. These
issues are documented on the <a href="/security/fuzzer-2017.html">fuzzer</a>
page.</p>

                            <h4><span class="security_post_date">2017.05.26</span>Erroneous Session Resumption</h4>
                            <p>We discovered that the server could be convinced to permit TLS
session resumption before the authentication finished. A partial fix
was put into 3.0.13. Pavel Kankovsky verified that the fix was
insufficient, and provided a tool to test the issue. A better fix
was put into the server, and was released in version 3.0.14.</p>

<p>The original EAP-TLS code would refuse to resume sessions unless
there were policy attributes in the session cache. This check was
put in place to work around this issue with the OpenSSL API. At some
point, the code was changed to cache policy attributes by default,
which opened up the vulnerability. Given the long history of the
server, it is not clear when that change was made.</p>

<p><strong>FIX:</strong> The short-term fix is to disable session resumption in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cache</code> subsection of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">eap</code> module.</p>

<p>We believe that this issue affects version 2.1.1 through
2.1.7 inclusive. Other versions seem to be unaffected. We remind
users that versions 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x are old
and unsupported. Patches for those versions will not be released, as
the issue can be corrected with a minor configuration change. We
also note that prior to version 3, the session cache was disabled by
default, and required administrator intervention to enable it.</p>

<p>The v4.0.x branch is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying
code has been refactored to hide the TLS session data until the
final EAP Success is sent, in the Access-Accept. This change means
that the issue is impossible to reoccur in the future.</p>

<p>At this time, we have not had reports of the issue being exploited
in the wild.</p>

license so that we could scan FreeRADIUS. We scanned the v3.0.x
branch of the server, as of <a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/3047fc60a7df94c101e525b2e9a4b4a184232cec">commit

                            <p>Denis Andzakovic found issues with the decryption of very
long Tunnel-Passwords. The decryption routines could walk off of the
end of a buffer, and write to adjacent addresses. The data being
written is not under control of an attacker. The end result is
usually a crash of the server.</p>

<p>The initial report was for version 3.0. We determined that the
v3.1.x branch in git is also vulnerable. Version 2 has similar code
for Tunnel-Password, which we were not able to exploit. However, for
safety, all currently supported versions of the server were fixed.</p>

<p>The packet decoder in FreeRADIUS ensures that the only time this
issue is exploitable is when a proxy server receives a long
Tunnel-Password attribute in the reply from a home server. The
attack cannot be performed by a RADIUS client, or an end user. As
such, the exploitability of the attack is limited to systems within
the trusted RADIUS environment.</p>

<p>We are releasing version 2.2.9 and version 3.0.10 to correct
the issue.</p>

                            <p>oCert-CVE 2015-4680</p>

<p>All versions which implement EAP-TLS, prior to 2.2.8 and 3.0.9 do
not check intermediate CAs for revocation. We have put patches into
the version 2 and version 3 branches to fix these issues.</p>

<p>We expect that this issue has minimal effect on the majority of
RADIUS systems. If you are using a self-signed CA for 802.1X, this
issue does not seriously affect you, as only you can issue
intermediate certificates. If you are using certificates from a
public CA, then your configuration already permits third parties to
issue certificates which will be accepted by your RADIUS server.</p>

<p>i.e. The act of using a public CA cert in RADIUS can open your
systems to security issues which are larger, and much worse than
this one. The fix for this particular issue does not change the
underlying security problem behind using a public CA.</p>

<p>Our analysis of the issue led us to disagree with the analysis done
by oCert, and the (alleged) original vendor who made the report. We
a requested a response to our analysis, and oCert refused. We
requested that the public notice contain an accurate description of
the issue and it’s impact. oCert again refused. After repeated
messages, the response from Andrea Barisani of oCert was:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>The reporter disagrees with your assessment yet cannot share details
about their setup, oCERT has no wishes to do technical support on
their setup as we just care about the reported bug.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which is missing the point. We never asked to do “technical support
on their setup”. We asked for an accurate description of the issue
and it’s impact. oCert refused, whichs means that they do not, in
fact, “care about the reported bug”.</p>

<p>We wanted to work together to come up with an accurate description
of the issue, including it’s impact. It was clear that oCert was had
no such goal. They saw their work as simply taking the original
report, and forwarding it to a wider audience (including us).</p>

<p>We can only conclude that our analysis is correct, and that the
original report, and the summary published by oCert is largely
wrong. We can also recommend that people avoid oCert, as they are
unwilling to work with authors to publish accurate reports.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The EAP-PWD packet length is not checked before the first byte

module to dereference a NULL pointer, and will cause the server
to crash.</li>
  <li>The commit message payload length is not validated before the
packet is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in
the server.</li>
  <li>The confirm message payload length is not validated before the

  <li>A strcpy() was used to pack a C string into an EAP-PWD packet.

one byte.</li>

if the server was configured to use this module for authentication,
users with an expired password could successfully authenticate, even
though their access should have been denied. We recommend managing
users in a database, instead of leveraging /etc/passwd. The fact
that a user has login access to a machine does not necessarily mean
that they can use RADIUS for other kinds of network access.</p>

The issue was found by Timo Warns, and communicated
to security@freeradius.org. A sample exploit for the issue was
included in the notification.</p>

<p>We recommend all administrators using EAP and 2.1.10, 2.1.11,
2.1.12, or the git “master’ branch upgrade immediately.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was created in <a href="https://github.com/FreERADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/a368a6f4f4aaf">commit
a368a6f4f4aaf</a>
on August 18, 2010. Vulnerable versions include 2.1.10, 2.1.11, and
2.1.12. Also anyone running the git “master” branch after August 18,
2010 is vulnerable.</p>

<p>All sites using TLS-based EAP methods and the above versions
are vulnerable. The only configuration change which can avoid the
issue is to disable EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP.</p>

<p>An external attacker can use this vulnerability to over-write the
stack frame of the RADIUS server, and cause it to crash. In
addition, more sophisticated attacks may gain additional privileges
on the system running the RADIUS server.</p>

<p>This attack does not require local network access to the
RADIUS server. It can be done by an attacker through a WiFi Access
Point, so long as the Access Point is configured to use 802.1X
authentication with the RADIUS server.</p>

<p>We scanned the rlm_eap_tls.c file with the LLVM checker-267, taken
from http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/. It did not find this issue.
However, a Coverity scan did discover it.</p>

<p>The OCSP functionality in 2.1.11 could be enabled manually, but it
would never mark certificates as revoked. As such, it did not behave
as expected.</p>

                            <p>If FreeRADIUS depends on a database, and the database goes down for

<p>As with many such notifications, the issuer did not communicate with
us before releasing the alleged vulnerability. We also disagree with
their description of the problem.</p>

<p>The short description of this problem is that any administrator who
can (a) take the database down, or (b) disrupt communication between
FreeRADIUS and the database can prevent FreeRADIUS from
operating correctly. This result should not be a surprise.</p>

<p>In normal operation, when the server stops responding to
packets (i.e. because the database is down), the NAS will stop
sending it packets, and will fail over to another server. In
addition, our tests indicate that this issue occurs only when the
database is down for extended periods of time, and the server
receives many millions of packets during that time. i.e. the problem
will not occur in most deployments.</p>

<p>There is no possibility for privilege escalation, or access to the
system running FreeRADIUS. The issue is marked “network exploitable”
in the CVE database because it requires the network to be <em>down</em> for
the attack to work.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to upgrade to the latest version of the
server. We also recommend that mission-critical systems
be monitored. If they go offline for extended periods, they should
be restarted.</p>

<p>The DHCP functionality in 2.1.9 is <em>not</em> enabled by default.
Enabling it requires code modifications, a complete re-build and
re-install of the server, and a manual enabling of DHCP in
the configuration. Further, the DHCP functionality is marked
“experimental” in this release. As such, it should be used only on
trusted networks.</p>

<p>This issue is exploitable whenever FreeRADIUS has had DHCP
functionality enabled, and where the administrator has manually
configured the server to accept DHCP packets. Any DHCP packet with a
“Relay Agent” sub-option can cause FreeRADIUS to enter an
infinite loop.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to run experimental features only in
trusted networks.</p>

                            <p>This issue affects version 1.1.5 and earlier.</p>

<p>A malicous 802.1x supplicant could send malformed Diameter format
attributes inside of an EAP-TTLS tunnel. The server would reject the
authentication request, but would leak one <code class="highlighter-rouge">VALUE_PAIR</code> data
structure, of approximately 300 bytes. If an attacker performed the
attack many times (e.g. thousands or more over a period of minutes
to hours), the server could leak megabytes of memory, potentially
leading to an “out of memory” condition, and early process exit.</p>

<p>We recommend that administrators using EAP-TTLS upgrade immediately.</p>

<p>While the summary is superficially correct, and there is a stack

has been updated to no longer claim the issue is
remotely exploitable. They do not, however, include our <a href="https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-devel/2007-January/010717.html">vendor

though they do reference it. They also list the issue as “High
Risk”, and “Gain Privileges”, which is <em>NOT TRUE</em>, for the reasons
outlined below.</p>

<p>In summary, the issue is <em>not remotely exploitable</em>. It is
exploitable by local administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files. If an attacker can write to the server
configuration files, they can configure the server to run
arbitrary programs. Exploiting the server via a stack overflow would
be unnecessary.</p>

<p>The solution to this “vulnerability”, of course, is to ensure that
only the correct people are given write access to the server
configuration files.</p>

                            <p>Multiple issues exist with version 1.0.4, and all prior versions of
the server. Externally exploitable vulnerabilities exist only for
sites that use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rlm_sqlcounter</code> module. Those sites may be
vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, similar to the issues
noted below. All sites that have not deployed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rlm_sqlcounter</code>
module are not vulnerable to external exploits. However, we still
recommend that all sites upgrade to version 1.0.5.</p>

<p>The issues are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL Injection attack in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rlm_sqlcounter</code> module.</li>
  <li>Buffer overflow in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rlm_sqlcounter</code> module, that may cause a
server crash.</li>
  <li>Buffer overflow while expanding %t, that may cause a
server crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues were found by Primoz Bratanic. As the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rlm_sqlcounter</code>
module is marked “experimental” in the server source, it is not
enabled or configured in most sites. As a result, we believe that
the number of vulnerable sites is low.</p>

<p>Additional issues, not externally exploitable, were found by Suse. A
full response to their report is available

to 1.0.3. Sites not using the SQL module are not affected by
this issue. However, we still recommend that all sites upgrade to
version 1.0.3.</p>

<p>The issues are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buffer overflow - A long string could overflow an internal
buffer in the SQL module, and write two bytes of text [0-9a-f]
past the end of the buffer. The server may exit when this
happens, resulting in a DoS attack. Depending on the local
configuration of the server, this may occur before a user
is authenticated. This vulnerability is externally exploitable,
but can not result in the execution of arbitrary code.</li>
  <li>SQL injection attacks - The SQL module suffers from SQL
injection attacks in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">group_membership_query</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">simul_count_query</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">simul_verify_query</code>
configuration entries. The first query is exploitable if your
site is configured to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SQL-Group</code> attribute in any
module in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authorize</code> section of <code class="highlighter-rouge">radiusd.conf</code>. The last
two queries are exploitable only if your site has user names

                            <h4><span class="security_post_date">2014.04.08</span>OpenSSL Heartbleed</h4>
                            <p><a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> bug.</p>

<p>OpenSSL has a major security issue, seen in to
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160%0A">CVE-2014-0160</a>.
The issue mainly affects servers such as SMTPS or HTTPS, which allow
random IP addresses to connect to them via TLS. Those sites must
assume that all information available to the system using TLS has
been compromised.</p>

<p>Based on further information from Jouni Malinen, it appears that
both Version 2 and Version 3 of FreeRADIUS are vulnerable to
the attack. It is likely that earlier versions of the server are
vulnerable, too.</p>

<p>The problem appears to be that OpenSSL has already allowed invalid
reads by the time that FreeRADIUS detects the invalid heartbeat, and
closes the connection. The benefit of the way FreeRADIUS uses
OpenSSL is that the attack appears to be limited to reading ~1K of
data from the stack, when the server receives the
malicious heartbeat. This limitation mitigates the attack, but does
not remove the possibility of exposing private information.</p>

<p>We recommend that all administrators upgrade OpenSSL immediately.</p>

<p>Administrators can detect “heartbleed” attacks by looking in their
logs for a message containing the text <code class="highlighter-rouge">Invalid ACK received: 24</code>.
If such a message is seen, it means that the attack has
been attempted. You should upgrade your version of
OpenSSL immediately.</p>

<p>We suggest that all administrators upgrade all of their systems to a
version of OpenSSL which is not vulnerable to this attack. Sites
which allow random IPs to connect to a TLS server (e.g. SMTPS
or HTTPS) should assume that all information available to those
servers has been stolen from those systems. This information
includes user credentials, keys for private certificates, cookies
sent over HTTPS, etc.</p>

<p>We have updated FreeRADIUS (all versions) so that it refuses to
start when it detects the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.</p>

<p><strong>v3.0.x</strong> - Administrators can over-ride this check by setting
<code class="highlighter-rouge">allow_vulnerable_openssl = CVE-2014-0160</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">security</code>
subsection of radiusd.conf.</p>

<p><strong>v2.2.x</strong> - Administrators can over-ride this check by setting
<code class="highlighter-rouge">allow_vulnerable_openssl = yes</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">security</code> subsection
of radiusd.conf.</p>

        <h4>FreeRADIUS Security</h4>
        <h5>Defensive Programming</h5>
        <p>All input is sanity-checked before use.</p>

        <h5>Clean code</h5>
        <p>There are no C compiler warnings in the build. Builds performed by developers have -Werror set, so that new errors are not introduced.</p>

        <h5>Builds with multiple compilers</h5>
        <p>We use GCC and CLANG for all builds. Each compiler produces a slightly different set of warnings. As seen above, no warnings from any compiler are allowed in the build.</p>

        <h5>Builds on multiple operating systems</h5>
        <p>We always build on Mac OSX and Ubuntu. We are in the process of adding FreeBSD and CentOS.</p>

        <h5>Builds are done with every single module, and multiple feature permutations</h5>
        <p>There is no portion of the server which has "code rot" because it has not been built for years.</p>

        <h5>Continuous testing</h5>
        <p>The src/tests/ directory has a growing set of tests for server functionality. These tests help ensure that new commits do not accidentally break existing functionality</p>

        <h5>Continuous integration</h5>
        <p>Commits are built and tested via travis</p>

        <h5>Static analysis (3X!)</h5>
        <p>Builds are performed weekly with Coverity. Builds are performed daily with Clang static analyzer and cppcheck. The server must build with no errors before it can be released.</p>
        <p>These practices are not perfect. The test suite is growing, but it does not cover all of the servers functionality. As a result, the latest releases may still have bugs. The version 2 "stable" release undergoes less code churn and is the "long term support" stable and bug-free release. The version 3 "feature" release has significantly more code churn, and therefore, may have more issues than version 2</p>
