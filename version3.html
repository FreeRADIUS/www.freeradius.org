<h1>Version 3</h1>

<p>The "feature release" of FreeRADIUS
is <a href="version3.html">version 3</a>.  The goal of this version is
<b>functionality</b>.  Version 3 introduces a number of major changes over
Version 2.  The debugging output is clearer (and colorized!), more
errors are found while the configuration files are parsed instead of
at run-time, RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec) and RADIUS over TCP are
supported.  The <tt>raddb/</tt> directory has been re-arranged so that
files are easier to find.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from Version 2</h2>

<p>The configuration of Version 3 is similar to that of Version 2.
That similarity means that most of the documentation for v2 still
applies to v3.  This includes third-party documentation, the Wiki,
etc.  However, we do <em>not</em> recommend using a v2 configuration
with v3.  We do <em>not</em> recommend starting with a v2
configuration, and trying to "tweak" it to be acceptable to v3.</p>

<p>Instead, administrators should start with the default v3
configuration, and gradually add in their local changes.  Doing so
will ensure that you start off with a working configuration, go to the
next step with a working configuration, and end with a working
configuration.</p>

<p>The differences between the two versions are documented in
the <a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.0.x/raddb/README.rst">README.rst</a>
file distributed with version 3.  We recommend that administrators
read that file before starting the upgrade process.</p>
