There is an externally exploitable root compromise in rlm\_smb, through a stack
overflow when a password greater than 128 bytes referenced by
the module. The module is not built or installed by default, so we
have not released a 0.9.4. This vulnerability is fixed in the CVS
snapshots, and will be included in any later release of the server.
