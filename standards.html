<h1>Compliance to Standards</h1>

<p>FreeRADIUS is compliant with all
<a href="http://ietf.org/">IETF</a> <a href="http://freeradius.org/rfc/">RFCs</a>.  We have authored or co-authored the following documents:</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="date"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6613">RFC 6613</a></span> - RADIUS Over TCP</dt>

<dd>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol has,
   until now, required the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the
   underlying transport layer.  This document defines RADIUS over the
   Transmission Control Protocol (RADIUS/TCP), in order to address
   handling issues related to RADIUS over Transport Layer Security
   (RADIUS/TLS).  It permits TCP to be used as a transport protocol for
   RADIUS only when a transport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides
   confidentiality and security.</dd>

<br />
<dt><span class="date"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6158">RFC 6158</a></span> - RADIUS Design Guidelines</dt>

<dd>This document provides guidelines for the design of attributes used
   by the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol.
   It is expected that these guidelines will prove useful to authors and
   reviewers of future RADIUS attribute specifications, within the IETF
   as well as other Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).</dd>

<br />
<dt><span class="date"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5997">RFC 5997</a></span> - Use of Status-Server Packets in the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Protocol</dt>

<dd>This document describes a deployed extension to the Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol, enabling
   clients to query the status of a RADIUS server.  This extension
   utilizes the Status-Server (12) Code, which was reserved for
   experimental use in RFC 2865.</dd>

<br />
<dt><span class="date"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5080">RFC 5080</a></span> - Common Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Implementation Issues and Suggested Fixes</dt>

<dd>This document describes common issues seen in Remote Authentication
   Dial In User Service (RADIUS) implementations and suggests some
   fixes.  Where applicable, ambiguities and errors in previous RADIUS
   specifications are clarified.</dd>

</dl>

<p>FreeRADIUS is also compliant with many 3GPP, 3GPP2, and WiMAX
standards.  Those are too numerous to list here.</p>

<p>Where FreeRADIUS does not follow the RFC recommendations, the RFC
is wrong, or has been updated
by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5080">RFC 5080</a>.  That
document correct numerous errors and omissions in previous
specifications.</p>

<p>We also authored
the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6158">Design Guidelines</a>
document.  This specification defines how standards bodies and vendors
should design RADIUS specifications.  It also contains recommendations
for implementations.  We <em>highly recommend</em> that all vendors
read this document.  Failure to follow its guidelines means that your
product will not be compatible with existing RADIUS
implementations.</p>
