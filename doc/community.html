<h1>Community Documentation Effort</h1>

<p>As of May 2010, we have started a community documentation effort.
This effort will increase the usability, content, and formatting of
the current documentation.  We will be
using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">Restructured
Text</a> for the format.  It is easy to create, easy to read, and can
be converted to a number of other formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)<p>

<p>Please read
the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">RST
quick reference"</a> guide for an introduction to the format.  It is
plain text, with minimal markup.  An example of the new format is
available on
GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/blob/master/doc/load-balance.rst">load-balance.rst</a>.
The document looks much better than
the <a href="http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/blob/8ed7604ac4f86f998e7e76647d9574e89739745d/doc/load-balance.txt">old
version.</a></p>

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>

<p>Github makes it easy to contribute.  You will need an SSH key, and
some familiarity with git.  For those who don't use git, please just
edit the documentation directly, and send the new version to
the <a href="/list/users.html">freeradius-users</a> list.</p>

<ol>

<li>Set up an account on Github.
The <a href="http://help.github.com/">help</a> page contains a lot of
useful information.  See the "Setup" link on the right side of the
page for detailed instructions on using git, SSH, etc.</li>

<li><a href="http://help.github.com/forking/">Fork</a>
the <a href="http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server">freeradius-server</a>
repository.</li>

<li>Edit the files in the "doc" directory.  Don't bother doing the
usual <tt>configure / make / make install</tt> process.  It isn't
necessary.  See also the <a href="git.html">FreeRADIUS-specific</a>
git instructions.</li>

<li>Push the changes back to github</li>

<li>We will integrate the changes from your version into the "master" version</li>

<li>Periodically pull everyone elses changes from "upstream"</li>

<li>Enjoy better documentation!</li>

</ol>

<h2>Long-term Goals</h2>

<p>The longer term goals of the project are to radically improve the
existing documentation.  That goal can be reached by following a few
simple steps</p>

<ol>

<li>Convert the existing documentation to RST.  Don't worry about
content, cross-references, English grammer, or spelling mistakes.
Just do a simple conversion for formatting.</li>

<li>Re-organize the files to have consistent names.  This step allows
people to "guess" where the documentation is located, and to have
their guesses be correct.</li>

<li>Cross-reference all of the documentation.  RST allows cross
references, and we should use them!  This step allows us to create an
HTML version with all of the documentation linked together for ease of
use.</li>

<li>Audit the files for text that is out of date, or just wrong.  Fix
the text, and point to any new documentation.</li>

<li>Write more documentation!  Howtos, explanations, etc.!</li>

<li>Adding documentation from
the <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/">Wiki</a>.  It's probably
best to have one "canonical" reference for all of the documentation.
The current Wiki has had files added to it over time by many
people.  This means it's not as well organized as it could be.</li>

</ol>

<p>The result should be a large set of clear, consistent, and high
quality documentatation.  Thanks to everyone for your efforts!</p>
