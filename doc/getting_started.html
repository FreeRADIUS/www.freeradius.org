<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>A number of "getting started" guides are available
from <a href="http://networkradius.com/doc.html">Network RADIUS</a>.
In particular, we recommend
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/FreeRADIUS%20Technical%20Guide.pdf">Technical
Guide</a>, which should be read by every new RADIUS administrator.  It
explains RADIUS concepts, and covers how to perform introductory
administation and maintenance.  More in-depth guides are available on
the same page.</p>

<h2>Installing the Server</h2>

<p>Where possible, we recommend using the packaging system that is
used by your operating system.  The version that is supplied by your
OS might be out of date, but it is likely to work "out of the box".</p>

<p>If you need to install it yourself, the
Wiki <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Installation">installation</a>
page contains detailed instructions for a number of platforms.</p>

<h2>Starting the Server</h2>

<p>Once it has been installed, the first thing to do is <em>change as
little as possible</em>.  The default configuration is designed to
work everywhere, and to perform nearly every authentication
method.</p>

<hr />
<em>
Do not edit the default configuration files until you understand what
they do.  This means reading the documentation contained in the
comments of the configuration files.
</em><hr />

<p>Many common configurations are documented as suggestions or
examples in the configuration files.  Many common problems are
discussed in the configuration files, along with suggested solutions.</p>

<p>We recommend reading the configuration files, in large part because
most of the configuration items are documented <em>only</em> in the
comments in the configuration files.</p>

<p>When the server has been installed on a new machine, the first step
is to start it in debugging mode, as user <code>root</code>:</p>

<pre>
$ radiusd -X
</pre>

<p>This step demonstrates that the server is installed and configured
properly.  If you have installed Version 2 from source, this step will
also create the default certificates used for EAP authentication.</p>

<h2>Initial Tests</h2>

<p>Testing authentication is simple.  Edit the <code>users</code>
file, and add the following line of text at the top, before anything
else:</p>

<pre>
testing Cleartext-Password := "password"
</pre>

<p>Start the server in debugging mode (<code>radiusd -X</code>), and
run <code>radtest</code> from another terminal window:</p>

<pre>
$ radtest testing password 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
</pre>

<p>You <em>should</em> see the server respond with
an <tt>Access-Accept</tt>.  If it doesn't, the debug log will show
why.  Paste the output into
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/freeradius.html">debug form</a>,
and a colorized HTML version will be produced.  Look for red or yellow
text, and read the messages.</p>

<p>If you do see an <tt>Access-Accept</tt>,
then <em>congratulations</em>, the following authentication methods
now work for the <tt>testing</tt> user:</p>

<pre>
PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAPv1, MS-CHAPv2, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-GTC, EAP-MD5.
</pre>

<p>The next step is to add more users, and to configure databases.
Those steps are outside of the scope of this short web page, but the
general method to use is important, and is outlined in the next
section.</p>

<hr />
<em>
The following steps outline the best known method for configuring the
server.  Following them lets you create complex configurations with a
minimm of effort.  Failure to follow them leads to days of frustration
and wasted effort.
</em>
<hr />

<h2>Configuring the Server</h2>

<p>Changing the server configuration should be done via the following
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a "known working" configuration, such as supplied by
the default installation.</li>
<li>Make one <em>small</em> change to the configuration files.</li>
<li>Start the server in debugging mode (<code>radiusd -X</code>).</li>
<li>Verify that the results are what you expect
<ul>
<li>The debug output shows any configuration changes you have made.</li>
<li>Databases (if used) are connected and operating.</li>
<li>Test packets are accepted by the server.</li>
<li>The debug output shows that the packets are being processed as you
expect.</li>
<li>The response packets are contain the attributes you expect to see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If everything is OK, save a copy of the configuration, go back to
step (2), and make another change.</li>
<li>If anything goes wrong,
<ul>
<li>double-check the configuration</li>
<li>read the <em>entire</em> debug output, looking for words
like <code>error</code> or <code>warning</code>.  These messages
usually contain descriptions of what went wrong, and suggestions for
how it can be fixed. (see also
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/freeradius.html">debug
form</a>)</li>
<li>Try replace your configuration with a saved copy of a "known
working" configuration, and start again.  This process can clean up
errors caused by temporary edits, or edits that you have forgotten
about.</li>
<li>Ask for help on
the <a href="/list/users.html">freeradius-users</a> mailing list.
Include a description of what you are trying to do, and the <em>entire
debugging output</em>, especially output showing the server receiving
and processing test packets.  You may want to scrub "secret"
information from the output before posting it.  (Shared secrets,
passwords, etc.) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
