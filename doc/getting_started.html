<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This page describes how to perform the initial configuration of
FreeRADIUS.  It assumes a basic knowledge of Unix system
administration.  No RADIUS knowledge is required.</p>

<h2>Installing the Server</h2>

<p>Where possible, we recommend using the packaging system that is
used by your operating system.  The version that is supplied by your
OS might be out of date, but it is likely to work "out of the box".</p>

<p>If you need to install it yourself, the
Wiki <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Installation">installation</a>
page contains detailed instructions for a number of platforms.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we assume that you can install the server via something
like <code>yum install freeradius</code>, or <code>apt-get install
freeradius</code>.</p>

<p>Note that in Debian-based systems, the server daemon is
called <code>freeradius</code> instead of <code>radiusd</code> The
configuration files are also located in <code>/etc/freeradius</code>
instead of <code>/etc/raddb/</code>.  We use <code>radiusd</code>
and <code>/etc/raddb/</code> in this guide, and trust that Debian
administrators can translate to their system.</p>

<h2>Some background</h2>

<p>Once the server has been installed, the first thing to do
is <em>change as little as possible</em>.  The default configuration
is designed to work everywhere, and to perform nearly every
authentication method.</p>

<hr />
<p>
<em>
Do not edit the default configuration files until you understand what
they do.  This means reading the documentation contained in the
comments of the configuration files.
</em>
</p>
<hr />

<p>Many common configurations are documented as suggestions or
examples in the configuration files.  Many common problems are
discussed in the configuration files, along with suggested solutions.</p>

<p>We recommend reading the configuration files, in large part because
most of the configuration items are documented <em>only</em> in the
comments in the configuration files.</p>

<p>We recommend <em>reading the debug output of the server</em>. While
it contains a lot of text, it usually contains error messages which
describe exactly what went wrong, and how to fix it.</p>

<h2>Starting the server</h2>

<p>When the server has been installed on a new machine, the first step
is to start it in debugging mode, as user <code>root</code>:</p>

<pre>
$ radiusd -X
</pre>

<p>This step demonstrates that the server is installed and configured
properly.  If the output says <code>Ready to process requests</code>,
then all is well.</p>

<p>Otherwise, typical errors include <code>Address already in
use</code>, which means that there is another radius server already
running.  You will need to find that one and stop it before running
the server in debugging mode.</p>

<h2>Initial Tests</h2>

<p>Testing authentication is simple.  Edit the <code>users</code> file
(in v3 this has been moved
to <code>raddb/mods-config/files/authorize</code>), and add the
following line of text at the top of the file, before anything
else:</p>

<pre>
testing Cleartext-Password := "password"
</pre>

<p>Start the server in debugging mode (<code>radiusd -X</code>), and
run <code>radtest</code> from another terminal window:</p>

<pre>
$ radtest testing password 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
</pre>

<p>You <em>should</em> see the server respond with
an <tt>Access-Accept</tt>.  If it doesn't, the debug log will show
why.  In version 2, you can paste the output into
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/freeradius.html">debug form</a>,
and a colorized HTML version will be produced.  In version 3, the
output will be colorized.  Look for red or yellow text, and read the
relvant messages.  They should describe exactly what went wrong, and
how to fix the problem.</p>

<p>If you do see an <tt>Access-Accept</tt>,
then <em>congratulations</em>, the following authentication methods
now work for the <tt>testing</tt> user:</p>

<pre>
PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAPv1, MS-CHAPv2, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-GTC, EAP-MD5.
</pre>

<p>The next step is to add more users, and to configure databases.
Those steps are outside of the scope of this short web page, but the
general method to use is important, and is outlined in the next
section.</p>

<h2>Adding a client</h2>

<p>The above test runs <code>radtest</code> from localhost.  It is
useful to add a new client, which can be done by editing
the <code>clients.conf</code> file.  Add the following contets:</p>

<pre>
client new {
	ipaddr = 192.0.2.1
	secret = testing123
}
</pre>

<p>You should change the IP address <code>192.0.2.1</code> to be the
address of the client which will be
sending <code>Access-Request</code> packets.</p>

<p>The client should also be configured to talk to the RADIUS server,
by using the IP address of the maching running the RADIUS server.  The
client should use the same secret as configured above in
the <code>client</code> section.</p>

<p>Then restart the server in debugging mode, and run a simple test
using the <code>testing</code> user.  You should see
an <code>Access-Accept</code> in the server output</p>

<hr />
<em>
The following steps outline the best known method for configuring the
server.  Following them lets you create complex configurations with a
minimm of effort.  Failure to follow them leads to days of frustration
and wasted effort.
</em>
<hr />

<h2>Configuring the Server</h2>

<p>Changing the server configuration should be done via the following
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a "known working" configuration, such as supplied by
the default installation.</li>
<li>Make one <em>small</em> change to the configuration files.</li>
<li>Start the server in debugging mode (<code>radiusd -X</code>).</li>
<li>Verify that the results are what you expect
<ul>
<li>The debug output shows any configuration changes you have made.</li>
<li>Databases (if used) are connected and operating.</li>
<li>Test packets are accepted by the server.</li>
<li>The debug output shows that the packets are being processed as you
expect.</li>
<li>The response packets are contain the attributes you expect to see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If everything is OK, save a copy of the configuration, go back to
step (2), and make another change.</li>
<li>If anything goes wrong,
<ul>
<li>double-check the configuration</li>
<li>read the <em>entire</em> debug output, looking for words
like <code>error</code> or <code>warning</code>.  These messages
usually contain descriptions of what went wrong, and suggestions for
how it can be fixed. (see also
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/freeradius.html">debug
form</a>)</li>
<li>Try replace your configuration with a saved copy of a "known
working" configuration, and start again.  This process can clean up
errors caused by temporary edits, or edits that you have forgotten
about.</li>
<li>Ask for help on
the <a href="/list/users.html">freeradius-users</a> mailing list.
Include a description of what you are trying to do, and the <em>entire
debugging output</em>, especially output showing the server receiving
and processing test packets.  You may want to scrub "secret"
information from the output before posting it.  (Shared secrets,
passwords, etc.) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>

<p>A number of guides are available
from <a href="http://networkradius.com/doc.html">Network RADIUS</a>.
In particular, we recommend
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/FreeRADIUS%20Technical%20Guide.pdf">Technical
Guide</a>, which should be read by every new RADIUS administrator.  It
explains RADIUS concepts, and covers how to perform introductory
administation and maintenance.  More in-depth guides are available on
the same page.</p>
