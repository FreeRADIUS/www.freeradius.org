<h1>FreeRADIUS Documentation</h1>

<p>Configuring the server can be a complex task.  This task is made
easier in recent versions, as we gradually improve the documentation
and "default" configurations.</p>

<p>You can help!  Just edit
the <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/">wiki</a>.  It takes less
than five minutes, and it will help thousands of other people</p>

<p>If you are using Version 1 or 2 of the server, we suggest upgrading
to <a href="/version3.html">Version 3</a>.  Version 1 is no longer
supported, and Version 2 is EOL</p>

<p>The first step is the <a href="getting_started.html">getting started</a> page.</p>

<p>The <a href="debugging,html">debugging</a> page describes how to
debug the server.  <em>PLEASE READ IT.</em>  Many problems can be
solved by running the server in debugging mode, and reading the output.</p>

<p>If all else fails, <a href="http://networkradius.com">commercial
support</a> is available.</p>


<h2>Where the Documentation is located</h2>

<p>The server comes with documentation.  The <tt>doc/</tt> directory
contains a number of files, named for their functionality.  The
configuration files contain <strong>enormous</strong> amounts of
documentation.  Each configuration directive is documented in comments
where it is used.  The <tt>raddb/sites-available</tt> directory
contains many example "virtual servers".  Each example has comments
describing what it does, when it should be used, and how to configure
it.</p>

<p>Many people try to find documentation by typing keywords into
google. This method is not generally productive.  Most of the links
are to other people asking the same question, or to out-dated third
party documentation. Most people can easily get lost in a mess of
contradictory and confusing documentation, leading to frustration and
a badly configured server.</p>

<hr />
<em>Nearly all third-party documentation and How-To's are wrong and
outdated.  We <b>strongly</b> suggest that you do not follow any
documentation which is more than 4 years old.  If you do follow such
ancient documentation, the result will likely be a server that does
not work.
</em><hr />

<h3>Wiki</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org">Wiki</a> has a fair amount
of documentation and How-To's.  It is a good starting resource.</p>

<p>The Wiki is searchable.  Simply type in a few keywords, and you
will get pages which often answer your questions and help you solve
problems.</p>

<h3>Manual pages</h3>

<p>The on-line <a href="/radiusd/man/">man</a> pages contain documentation for
<a href="/radiusd/man/index.html#programs">programs</a>, <a href="/radiusd/man/index.html#files">configuration
files</a>,
and <a href="/radiusd/man/index.html#modules">modules.</a></p>

<p>All of the "man" pages are available on any system running
FreeRADIUS.  We suggest typing <tt>man radiusd</tt>, and reading it.
It contains instructions for configuring and debugging the server.</p>

<h3>Useful How-To's</h3>

<p>The web site <a href="http://deployingradius.com">Deploying
RADIUS</a> has a number of useful documents that are kept up to date
with newer versions of the server.  These documents include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A step by step guide to <a href="http://deployingradius.com/documents/configuration/eap.html">configuring EAP (TLS, PEAP, TTLS, etc.)</a>.</li>
<li>How to <a href="http://deployingradius.com/documents/configuration/active_directory.html">configure Active Directory</a> for authentication.</li>
<li>More instructions on <a href="http://deployingradius.com/documents/configuration/setup.html">setting up the server</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://deployingradius.com/documents/protocols/compatibility.html">table</a>
describing which authentication protocols are compatible with back-end
databases and password storage methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full Server Documentation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://networkradius.com/doc.html">Network RADIUS</a>
site has full server documentation.  It is a work in process, and is
as yet incomplete.  However, it has exensive documentation on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/current/upgrading/">upgrading to 3.0</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/current/unlang/keywords.html">Unlang keywords</a>.  i.e. "if", "update", etc.
</li>
<li><a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/current/unlang/condition.html">conditional syntax</a>.  i.e. how to use "if" statements in unlang.
</li>
<li><a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/current/raddb/mods-available/expansions.html">string expansions</a>.  i.e. <tt>"%{User-Name}"</tt>
</li>
<li><a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/current/raddb/mods-available/">modules</a>.  About three quarters of the modules are documented.  e.g. <a href="http://networkradius.com/doc/current/raddb/mods-available/eap.html">eap</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>API Documentation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://doc.freeradius.org">Doxygen</a> doc site has a
copy of the API documentation.  This is primarily for developers, but
may also be useful for notes describing hidden or advanced
options.</p>

<p>The API documentation site is not useful for people who want to
configure FreeRADIUS.</p>

<h3>Older Documents</h3>

<h3>Novell eDirectory Integration</h3>

<p>An administration guide to <a href="radiusadmin.pdf">FreeRADIUS and
Novell eDirectory</a> is available.  For the latest version of the
"Integrating Novell eDirectory with FreeRADIUS" administration guide,
refer
to <a href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/edir_radius/index.html">Novell's
site</a>.</p>
