<h1>FreeRADIUS Version 2 Documentation</h1>

<p>Configuring the server can be a complex task.  This task is made
easier in Version 2, as the documentation and "default" configurations
have been improved.</p>

<p>If you are using Version 1 of the server, we suggest upgrading to
Version 2.  Version 2 is much easier to install and configure.  The
documentation available for Version 1 is thin, and often out of date.
Even worse, there are many "third party" web sites that contain
instructions for configuring FreeRADIUS</p>

<hr />
<em>Nearly all of the documentation and How-To's on "third party" web
sites is wrong and outdated.  We <b>strongly</b> suggest that you do
not follow any non-FreeRADIUS documentation.  If you do follow
external documentation, the result will likely be a server that does
not work.
</em><hr />

<h3>Installing the Server</h3>

<p>Where possible, we recommend using the packaging system that is
used by your operating system.  The version that is supplied by your
OS might be out of date, but it is likely to work "out of the box".</p>

<p>If you need to install it yourself, the
Wiki <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Installation">installation</a>
page contains detailed instructions for a number of platforms.</p>

<h3>Starting the Server</h3>

<p>Once it has been installed, the first thing to do is <em>as little
as possible</em>.  The default configuration is designed to work
everywhere, and to provide nearly every authentication method.</p>

<hr />
<em>
Do not edit the default configuration files until you understand what
they do.  This means reading the documentation contained in the
comments of the configuration files.
</em><hr />

<p>Many common configurations are documented as suggestions or
examples in the configuration files.  Many common problems are
discussed in the configuration files, along with suggested solutions.</p>

<p>We recommend reading the configuration files, in large part because
most of the configuration items are documented <em>only</em> in the
comments in the configuration files.</p>

<p>When the server has been installed on a new machine, the first step
is to start it in debugging mode, as user <code>root</code>:</p>

<pre>
$ radiusd -X
</pre>

<p>This step demonstrates that the server is installed and configured
properly.  If you have installed Version 2 from source, this step will
also create the default certificates used for EAP authentication.</p>

<h3>Initial Tests</h3>

<p>Testing authentication is simple.  Edit the <code>users</code>
file, and add the following line of text at the top, before anything
else:</p>

<pre>
testing Cleartext-Password := "password"
</pre>

<p>Start the server in debugging mode (<code>radiusd -X</code>), and
run <code>radtest</code> from another terminal window:</p>

<pre>
$ radtest testing password 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
</pre>

<p>You <em>should</em> see the server respond with
an <tt>Access-Accept</tt>.  If it doesn't, the debug log will show
why.  Paste the output into
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/freeradius.html">debug form</a>,
and a colorized HTML version will be produced.  Look for red or yellow
text, and read the messages.</p>

<p>If you do see an <tt>Access-Accept</tt>,
then <em>congratulations</em>, the following authentication methods
now work for the <tt>testing</tt> user:</p>

<pre>
PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAPv1, MS-CHAPv2, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-GTC, EAP-MD5.
</pre>

<p>The next step is to add more users, and to configure databases.
Those steps are outside of the scope of this short web page, but the
general method to use is important, and is outlined in the next
section.</p>

<center>
<b>
The following steps outline the best known method for configuring the
server.  Following them lets you create complex configurations with a
minimm of effort.  Failure to follow them leads to days of frustration
and wasted effort.
</b>
</center>

<h3>Configuring the Server</h3>

<p>Changing the server configuration should be done via the following
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a "known working" configuration, such as supplied by
the default installation.</li>
<li>Make one <em>small</em> change to the configuration files.</li>
<li>Start the server in debugging mode (<code>radiusd -X</code>).</li>
<li>Verify that the results are what you expect
<ul>
<li>The debug output shows any configuration changes you have made.</li>
<li>Databases (if used) are connected and operating.</li>
<li>Test packets are accepted by the server.</li>
<li>The debug output shows that the packets are being processed as you
expect.</li>
<li>The response packets are contain the attributes you expect to see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If everything is OK, save a copy of the configuration, go back to
step (2), and make another change.</li>
<li>If anything goes wrong,
<ul>
<li>double-check the configuration</li>
<li>read the <em>entire</em> debug output, looking for words
like <code>error</code> or <code>warning</code>.  These messages
usually contain descriptions of what went wrong, and suggestions for
how it can be fixed. (see also
the <a href="http://networkradius.com/freeradius.html">debug
form</a>)</li>
<li>Try replace your configuration with a saved copy of a "known
working" configuration, and start again.  This process can clean up
errors caused by temporary edits, or edits that you have forgotten
about.</li>
<li>Ask for help on
the <a href="/list/users.html">freeradius-users</a> mailing list.
Include a description of what you are trying to do, and the <em>entire
debugging output</em>, especially output showing the server receiving
and processing test packets.  You may want to scrub "secret"
information from the output before posting it.  (Shared secrets,
passwords, etc.) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Debugging the Server</h3>

<p>This process is the same as configuring the server.  See the
section above.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<hr /><em>Run the server in debugging mode as suggested in the FAQ,
README, INSTALL, <code>man</code> page, and daily on the mailing
list.</em><hr />

<p>We cannot emphasize that strongly enough.  There is <b>no way</b>
for anyone to help you unless you post the debugging output along with
your question.  If you do not post the debugging output, your question will either be ignored, or you will receive a number of responses saying</p>

<hr /><em>Post the debug output as suggested in the FAQ, README,
INSTALL, <code>man</code> page, and daily on the mailing
list.</em><hr />

<p>A large number of problems can be trivially solved by having an
expert read the debug output.  If you do not post it to the list, you
are making it impossible for anyone to help you.<p>
