    <h1>Developers' List Information</h1>

    <p>The <em>freeradius-devel</em> mailing list is for developers of the <a
    href="/">FreeRADIUS server.</a> There are a few house-rules to which we'd
    like everybody on the list to adhere:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Developers only.</dt>
      <dd>This isn't meant to sound haughty, but people who have no
      intention of programming often think that their particular itch
      is too important for a discussion list containing only people
      just like themselves, so they'd rather bother the people who
      must certainly know all about their itch, the developers. 
      <em>Don't.</em> Would you call the manufacturer of your car, demand to
      speak to the designers, and ask them how to change the oil? If so, you
      deserve the flames that you'll get.</dd>

      <dt>No HTML on the list.</dt>
      <dd>If you're using a mail program that is HTML capable such as
      Netscape or Outlook, please turn HTML posting off. Many, many
      people on the list have chosen to use mail programs that aren't
      HTML capable and they can barely read your message -- it shows
      up as HTML junk. There are a lot of webpages 
      <a
      href="http://www.google.com/search?q=turn+off+html+outlook+netscape">
      that can show you how.</a>
      </dd>

      <dt>No vcards.</dt>
      <dd>Basically this is the same as HTML; if you don't actually
      use MIME in a useful way (such as base64 encoding a patch to
      make sure it doesn't get mangled along the way) please don't
      use it at all -- vcards etc show up as a lot of junk too.
      Again, there are a lot of webpages 
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=turn+off+vcard">that
      show you how.</a>
      </dd>

      <dt>Learn how to Quote.</dt>
      <dd>When replying to a message, quote only the relevant parts
      of the previous message, and reply <em>below</em> every quoted part. Also
      make sure you have set the quoting character to <code>"&gt;&nbsp;"</code>
      if your mailer has such a setting (like Outlook). This is a
      non-HTML, internet standard list -- things like "the original
      message is in blue my answer is in red" don't work. In MS
      Outlook this is called 
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+quoting+in+outlook">Internet-style quoting.</a>
      </dd>

      <dt>Starting a new subject.</dt>
      <dd>When you start a new subject, don't do it by replying to a
      previous message. Not even if you change the subject header --
      people use threaded mail readers, and even if you do change the
      subject header it still looks like your message is part of the
      discussion you are replying to. Simply start a new fresh
      message to <em>freeradius-devel@lists.freeradius.org .</em> </dd>

      <dt>Read the FAQ.</dt>
      <dd>Before asking the obvious, please check the FAQ at 
      <a href="http://www.freeradius.org/faq/">
      http://www.freeradius.org/faq/</a> to see if your question has been
      answered already.  (The FAQ list is pretty out-of-date, though.)</dd>

      <dt>Read the Netiquette.</dt>
      <dd>The netiquette has a few rules of behaviour that are
      applicable to all means of electronic communication. The
      netiquette is also known as 
      <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html">RFC1855.</a>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>How to subscribe and unsubscribe</h2>

    <p>This is a 'mailman' list, so most transactions should take place
    through the web interface.  If you don't have or don't want web access,
    you may use email to manage you subscription; mail 
    <em>freeradius-devel-request@lists.freeradius.org</em> with the word <code>help</code>
    in the body.
    </p>

    <h3>Subscribing to the list:</h3>

    <p>
    Visit the <a href="http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-devel">list's
    subscription page.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Unsubscribing from the list:</h3>

    <p> The same <a
    href="http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-devel">subscription
    page</a> is used for unsubscribing as well as subscribing.</p>

    <p>Simply enter your email address in the lowest box on that page and click
    the "Edit Options" page. If you don't know your password (anymore) there is
    a button on that page to get the system to mail your password back to you.
    </p>
