<p>If you consider yourself a programmer and are willing to contribute
(through discussion or coding), we'd love to have you on board. There
are <a href="development.html">development instructions</a> to suggest
how to help.</p>

<h1>Thanks!</h1>

<p>Development of the server is performed by a number of people
all over the world.  The FreeRADIUS Project thanks (in
alphabetical order by surname)...  <small>(and this list is by no
means exhaustive!)</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="credit">Alan Curry
  </span> has contributed many fixes for such things as proxying,
  replication, and realm support.  He also wrote the interface
  between the modules and the server core.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Alan DeKok
  </span> authored the dynamically loaded modules, and maintains
  the server core.  He's the project's benevolent dictator.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Jochen Friedrich
  </span> contributed SMUX and SNMP support.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Kostas Kalevras
  </span> wrote <code>dialup_admin</code>, a web/PHP front-end
  to administering LDAP/SQL back-ends for the server. Also maintains
  several server modules</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Mike Machado
  </span> wrote the MySQL module for the server.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Chad Miller 
  </span> wrote a new config parser,
  restructured autoconf, and designed this web site.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Nathan Neulinger
  </span> wrote the Kerberos authentication module.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Chris Parker
  </span> wrote the <code>attr_filter</code>
  module, contributed configuration file enhancements, and currently
  hosts FreeRADIUS.org, and the bug tracking system.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Adrian Pavlykevych
  </span> wrote the LDAP module, now maintained by Kostas Kalevras.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pe&ntilde;a
  </span> contributed LDAP and Debian fixes.</li>

  <li><span class="credit">Miquel van Smoorenburg </span> is the
  original author of <a
  href="http://www.radius.cistron.nl/">Cistron Radius,</a>
  FreeRADIUS' parent project, and was involved in setting up the
  FreeRADIUS project.</li>

</ul>

<p>The above descriptions are woefully inadequate to describe what the
developers do.  The proof is in <a href="getting.html">the
pudding,</a> as pudding hackers like to say.</p>

<p>Of course, this list isn't updated as often as it should be.  We
apologise to everyone that we neglect to thank.</p>
