  This statement misrepresents our position, which we have previously
articulated to Suse:

  (1) We are prepared to coordinate a public statement about the
      issues raised by Suse.

  (2) We have analyzed the issues raised by Suse, and we believe that
      the issues are minor, and not externally exploitable.

  (3) We believe a coordinated release is not necessary for minor bug
      fixes that have little or no customer impact.

  Saying we don't "want" to negotiate a coordinated release date is
inappropriate, and contradicts our previous statements to Suse.


  As background, Suse informed us privately of the issues, and asked
us to coordinate a release date.  We examined the issues they raised,
and determined that they did not have the severity claimed by Suse.
We then decided that a coordinated release date was not necessary, and
informed Suse of this.

  Further, we had substantial technical concerns with the report (66%
false positive rate, among others), which we raised with Suse.  To
this date, Suse has not responded in any way to our concerns.

  We are disappointed that Suse has felt it necessary to misrepresent
our position in a vendor forum.

  If anyone is interested in our full response to Suse's report,
please email me privately at <aland@freeradius.org>
