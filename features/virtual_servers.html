<h1>Virtual Servers</h1>

<p>The idea of virtual servers (or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting">virtual hosts</a>)
was first introduced in web servers such as Apache.  FreeRADIUS is the
first RADIUS server to implement this functionality.</p>

<p>This functionality is different from running a RADIUS server inside
of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual
machine</a> such as Xen or VMware.  It does not offer the same
protection as a virtual machine, but it is often much easier to
configure and maintain.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>RADIUS servers have traditionally had one configuration, and one
global policy that was applied to all incoming requests.  That global
policy was usually configured to select one or more sub-policies
(e.g. per-client or per-user).  The process of creating and
maintaining those policies has often been difficult.</p>

<p>The largest problem in creating and maintaining these policies was
in ensuring that changes to one sub-policy did not affect another
independent sub-policy.  As the number of users, devices, and policies
increases, the effort required to debug these policies becomes
significant.  Virtual servers simplify this process considerably.</p>

<p>In FreeRADIUS 2.0, virtual servers can be configured independently
for each of <a href="#ip">server IP address</a>, <a
href="#client">client IP address</a>, <a href="#home">home server
pool</a>, and <a href="#tunnel">inner TLS tunnel</a>.

<a name="ip"><h2>IP based</h2></a>

<p>The server can listen on multiple IP addresses, and each IP address
can have it's own independent policy for incoming packets. For
example, the following configuration enables the server to listen on
two IP addresses, and to apply independent policies to packets
received on each IP address.</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>
<pre class="config">
listen {
	ipaddr = 192.0.2.1
	port = 1812
	type = auth
	virtual_server = one
}

listen {
	ipaddr = 192.0.2.2
	port = 1812
	type = auth
	virtual_server = two
}

server one {
	...
}

server two {
	...
}
</pre>
</dd></dl>

<p>When packets are received on the IP address <tt>192.0.2.1</tt>,
they will be processed through the <tt>server one</tt> virtual server.
When packets are received on the IP address <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>, they
will be processed through the <tt>server two</tt> virtual server.</p>

<p>The contents of the <tt>server one</tt> and <tt>server two</tt>
sections are <tt>authorize</tt>, <tt>authenticate</tt>, etc. sections
used to process packets in version 1.x.</p>

<a name="client"><h2>Client based</h2></a>

<p>The server identifies RADIUS clients by IP address, and each client
can have it's own independent policy based on client source IP
address. For example, the following configuration enables the server
to have two clients, and to apply independent policies to packets
received from each IP address.</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>
<pre class="config">
listen {
	ipaddr = 192.0.2.3
	port = 1812
	type = auth
	# no server section is defined here
	clients = disambiguate
}

clients disambiguate {
	client one {
		ipaddr = 192.0.2.4
		secret = testing123
		virtual_server = one
	}

	client two {
		ipaddr = 192.0.2.5
		secret = testing567
		virtual_server = two
	}
}
...
# server one as above
# server two as above
</pre>
</dd></dl>

<p>When packets are received on the IP address <tt>192.0.2.3</tt>,
they will be processed through the <tt>server one</tt> virtual server
if they are received from <tt>client one</tt>.  When packets are
received on the same IP address (<tt>192.0.2.3</tt>), they will be
processed through the <tt>server two</tt> virtual server if they are
received from <tt>client two</tt>.</p>

<p>Both <em>IP based</em> and <em>client based</em> servers can be
used at the same time, so long as there is only one way to map an
incoming request to a virtual server.  If the same request can map to
multiple virtual servers, FreeRADIUS will return an error, and will
refuse to start.</p>

<a name="home"><h2>Home Server Pool based</h2></a>

<p>The server identifies RADIUS home servers by server pools for
fail-over and redundancy.  Each home server pool can have it's own
independent policy based on where the packet is being proxied. For
example, the following configuration enables the server to have two
home server pools, and to apply independent policies to packets that
are proxied to home servers in each pool.</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>
<pre class="config">
	...
	home_server_pool one {
		type = fail-over
		home_server = 192.0.2.10
		home_server = 192.0.2.11
		home_server = 192.0.2.12
		virtual_server = proxy-pool-one
	}
	home_server_pool two {
		type = fail-over
		home_server = 192.0.2.13
		home_server = 192.0.2.14
		home_server = 192.0.2.15
		virtual_server = proxy-pool-two
	}
	...
}
...
server proxy-pool-one {
	pre-proxy {
		...
	}
	post-proxy {
		...
	}
}
server proxy-pool-two {
	pre-proxy {
		...
	}
	post-proxy {
		...
	}
}
</pre>
</dd></dl>

<p>When requests are sent to one of the home servers listed in the
pool, they will be processed through the <tt>server
proxy-pool-one</tt>, or the <tt>server proxy-pool-two</tt> virtual
server.</p>

<a name="tunnel"><h2>TLS Tunnels</h2></a>

<p>The <a href="eap.html">EAP</a> tunneled methods present an
authentication request to FreeRADIUS inside of the TLS tunnel.  The
<tt>eap</tt> module can map these tunneled requests to a virtual
server.  This mapping enables <em>completely independent</em> policies
for each of the outer and inner tunneled sessions.  This configuration
was not possible in earlier versions of FreeRADIUS.</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>
<pre class="config">
modules {
	...
	eap {
		ttls {
			...
			virtual_server = inner-tunnel
		}
		peap {
			...
			virtual_server = inner-tunnel
		}
	}
	...
}
...
server inner-tunnel {
	...
}
</pre>
</dd></dl>

<p>When requests are received inside of a TTLS or PEAP tunnel, they
will be processed through the <tt>server inner-tunnel</tt> virtual
server.</p>
