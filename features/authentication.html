<h1>Authentication</h1>

<p>The server can <a
href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Authentication">authenticate</a> users
via PAP, CHAP, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAP</a>, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAPv2</a>, SIP
Digest, and all common <a href="eap.html">EAP</a> methods.</p>

<p>The ability to use a particular authentication protocol (PAP, CHAP,
types of <a href="eap.html">EAP</a>) is <em>completely</em> under the
control of the administrator.  In most cases, the choice of
authentication protocol is under control of the user or NAS.  However,
the server does not have to agree to accept that protocol.  It can
reject a request if it determines that a protocol is insufficiently
secure.</p>

<p>User passwords can be stored as clear-text, NT hashed (MD4), LM
hashed, MD5, salted-MD5, SHA1, salted-SHA1, or crypt
(e.g. <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>).  The <tt>pap</tt> module understands
passwords stored via the common LDAP method of using a header,
followed by password text.  (e.g. <tt>{header}text</tt>).  It
understands all commonly used header formats (<tt>{clear}</tt>,
<tt>{crypt}</tt>, etc.), and can parse the password text from
clear-text, a hex string, or a base-64 encoded string.</p>

<p>If a password is not available locally for some reason, the server
can pass the authentication to another system such as LDAP, PAM, Unix
(<tt>/etc/passwd</tt>), Kerberos, Active Directory, or RADIUS server
via RADIUS proxying.  Local programs (e.g. CGI scripts) can also be
used to authenticate users via shell scripts or any other method.  <a
href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Rlm_perl">Perl</a> or <a
href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Rlm_python">Python</a> scripts can be
pre-loaded into the server, which significantly lowers the cost of
running such programs.</p>

<p>The method used to obtain a "known good" password is completely
independent of the authentication protocol being used.  A system can
be deployed using <a href="eap.html">EAP</a> for authentication, and
can obtain passwords from a flat-tex file, LDAP, SQL, or even a Perl
or Python script.</p>

<p>All client operating systems are supported, including Windows XP
(SP1 and SP2) and Vista, Linux, Mac OSX, *BSD, and many others.
Supported device types include desktops, servers, embedded devices,
portables (phone, PDAs), etc.</p>

<p>With the <a href="/press/survey.html#users">wide deployment</a> of
the server, we can say with confidence that <em>all available</em>
devices and operating systems have been tested.</p>
