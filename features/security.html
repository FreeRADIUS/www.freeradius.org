<h1>Security</h1>

<p>A RADIUS server is a critical part of a network security system.
Any successful attack on a RADIUS server means that anyone can be
authenticated, with potentially catastrophic consequences.  Two
requirements are necessary for any secure server; secure source code,
and secure configuration.</p>

<h2>The Source Code is Secure</h2>

<p>The <a href="/security.html">security</a> page contains the public
record of security issues in FreeRADIUS.  (Try asking a commercial
vendor for <em>that</em> information!)  The <a
href="/development.html">source code</a> is freely available,
including the complete history of all changes.  Our policy is to be
transparent and open about all security issues with the server.</p>

<p>While this policy may seem to open the server to attacks from
people looking at the source code, the reality is different.  That
openness has permitted us to be part of the <a
href="http://scan.coverity.com">Coverity scan</a> project for over a
year.  <em>All</em> of the issues found by <a
href="http://coverity.com">Coverity</a> have been fixed.  That is, the
code has been scanned for a large class of potential issues, and has
been proven to not be vulnerable to those issues.</p>

<h2>"Fail-Safe" Configuration</h2>

<p>The server configuration is designed to be "fail-safe".  The
default configuration requires administrator edits before any user can
be authenticated.  The default configuration and internal policy is to
reject all requests that have not successfully been authenticated.</p>
