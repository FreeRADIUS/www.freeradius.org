<h1>Scalability</h1>

<p>The default configuration that is shipped with the server should
work for most sites under normal load.  For high-load systems, there
are a few configuration items should be changed in
<tt>raddb/radiusd.conf</tt>:</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>
<pre class="config">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;max_requests = 1024
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Change the number <tt>1024</tt> to a larger value, as suggested in
the comments just above that entry.</p>

<p>For systems with a high load and many CPUs, the following
configuration item should also be changed to a higher value:</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>
<pre class="config">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;max_servers = 32
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This number should be increased.  The best value to use depends on
local load and CPU power.  Some sites set this number as high as
<tt>500</tt>.</p>

<h2>That's it.</h2>

<p>The <em>same</em> RADIUS server will easily transition from
handling one request every few seconds, to handling thousands of
requests per second.  The only changes required to enable this scaling
are outlined above.  There is no need to purchase a "enterprise"
product license to obtain better performance, more realms, more RADIUS
clients, or any other feature.</p>

<p>In short, where commercial servers have "small business",
"enterprise", and "carrier class" versions of their product, there is
only one version of FreeRADIUS:</p>

<center>
<em>Carrier class stability and functionality for everyone.</em>
</center>

<p>We prefer to keep it <a href="simple.html">simple</a>.</p>

<p>As proof of it's scalability, the server is currently deployed in
multiple Fortune 500 companies, and Tier 1 ISPs and telecommunications
companies, as seen in the <a
href="/testimonials.html">testimonials</a> and <a
href="/press/survey.html">survey</a> pages.  Many organizations with
more than 10 million customers are dependant on FreeRADIUS for their
AAA needs.  For some of these large sites, and for most small sites
(10 to 1000 users) it is the <em>only</em> RADIUS server that is
used.</p>
