<h1>Scalability</h1>

<p>The server is designed with a "plug-in" <a
href="modules.html">module</a> system.  Any feature that is not needed
can be removed from the configuration.  Once it is removed from the
configuration, it does not affect server performance, memory use,
security, etc.  This flexibility enables the server to run on
platforms ranging from embedded systems (e.g. LinkSys WRT54G) to
multi-core machines with gigabytes of RAM.  Only minor configuration
changes are necessary when scaling from small systems (one packet
every few minutes), to large systems (manhy CPUs, hundreds of threads,
and thousands of packets per second).</p>

<p>The server is currently deployed in Fortune 500 companies, and Tier
1 ISPs and telecommunications companies, as seen in the <a
href="/testimonials.html">testimonials</a> and <a
href="/press/survey.html">survey</a> pages.  Many organizations with
more than 10 million customers are depending on FreeRADIUS for all AAA
functionality.  For some of these large sites, and for most small
sites (10 to 1000 users) it is the <em>only</em> RADIUS server that is
used.</p>
