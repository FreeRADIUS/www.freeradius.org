<h1>Performance</h1>

<p>When all configuration and policies are stored in RAM, the server
is capable of performing 10's of 1000's of PAP authentications per
second on commodity hardware.  Specific performance capabilities
depend on a number of factors, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database usage (flat-text files, LDAP, SQL)</li>
<li>RAM, CPU, disk, network speed and latencies</li>
<li>Use of EAP (SSL has significant CPU overhead)</li>
<li>complexity of policies</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, any commodity hardware will be sufficient for systems
up to a few hundred thousand users.  For a larger number of users,
issues such as high-availability and fail-over will control the choice
of hardware.  Once sufficient hardware has been deployed to meet
high-availability requirements, RADIUS performance will not be an
issue.</p>

<p>Some commercial servers claim surprisingly high numbers for their
performance.  In our tests, the security overhead of RADIUS (MD5
hashes) can account for up to fifty percent (50%) of the time spent
processing a packet.  Any claims that a product has more than double
the performance of a tuned FreeRADIUS installation are best viewed
with skepticism.</p>

<p>The choice of database can strongly affect server performance.
Each accounting packet may result in one or more write requests to a
database.  The database performance then limits how many accounting
packets can be processed, and therefore limits the performance of the
RADIUS server.  Many database cannot perform more than a few hundred
to a few thousand writes per second.  This database limitation in turn
lowers RADIUS performance to about the same number of packets per
second.</p>

<p>The best way to determine the performance of a server is via
testing.  FreeRADIUS comes with a tool called <tt>radclient</tt>,
which can be used for basic peformance testing.  A third party tool
called <a hrf="http://networkradius.com/radperf.html">RadPerf</a> is
also available.  It uses the FreeRADIUS libraries to implement the
RADIUS portion, and then builds more complex functionality on top of
that.  It can be used to simulate user logins, and can auto-generate
accounting packets for user sessions.
