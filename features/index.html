<h1>List of Features</h1>

<p>The server has all of the features that are found in a normal
RADIUS server implementation.  It is unique among Open Source RADIUS
servers in it's support for <a href="eap.html">EAP</a>.  In addition,
it has many capabilities not found in any other RADIUS products, even
commercial servers from large vendors.  In spite of that complexity,
it is <a href="simple.html">simple</a> to install and configure.</p>

<p>In short, if you need a certain feature, it is likely that
FreeRADIUS supports it.  Please see the links below for information on
specific functionality.</p>

<h2>Performance and Scalability</h2>

<p>The server is one of the <a href="fast.html">fastest</a> and <a
href="scalability.html">scalable</a> products we know of.  It's unique
<a href="modules.html">modular</a> design enables it to be stripped
down for embedded systems, or to expose all of the available features
where required.</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

<p>The server runs on a wide variety of <a href="os.html">Operating
Systems</a>.  Every effort is make to ensure it is 64-bit "clean",
though occasional issues are discovered during development.</p>

<p>A large number of CPU and OS architectures are have been verified
to work, and are supported via the <a href="/list/users.html">users
list</a>.  We suggest that the server be installed via a <a
href="os.html">pre-built package</a> if one is available.  If a
package does not exist for your system, it can be built from <a
href="download.html">source</a>.</p>

<h2>AAA Functionality</h2>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>The server can <a href="authentication.html">authenticate</a> users
via simple methods (PAP, CHAP, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAP</a>, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAPv2</a>, SIP
Digest) and all common <a href="eap.html">EAP</a> types.</p>

<h3>Authorization</h3>

<p>Both <a href="pre-auth.html">pre-authentication</a> and <a
href="post-auth.html">post-authentication</a> policies are supported.
Polices may be stored in databases, flat-text files, or in Perl or
Python scripts.</p>

<h3>Accounting</h3>

<h2>RFC's and Vendor Dictionaries</h2>

<p>All RADIUS <a href="/rfc/">RFC's</a> are supported.  Over 100 <a
href="vendors.html">vendor dictionaries</a> are supported.  FreeRADIUS
is <a href="/press/index.html#rfc5080">defining</a> the industry
standards for RADIUS.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<h2>Virtual Servers</h2>

<p>FreeRADIUS is the only RADIUS server (commercial or Open Source)
that supports <a href="virtual_servers.html">virtual servers</a>.
This feature is similar to the virtual servers used in well-known web
servers such as Apache.  This feature can simplify complex
implementations, and can reduce ongoing support and maintenance
costs.</p>
