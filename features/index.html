<h1>List of Features</h1>

<p>The server has all features which are expected to be found in a
normal RADIUS server implementation.  In addition, it is unique among
Open Source RADIUS servers in it's support for <a
href="eap.html">EAP</a>.  It also has many capabilities not found in
any other RADIUS product, including commercial servers from large
vendors.</p>

<p>In short, if you need a certain feature, it is likely that
FreeRADIUS supports it.  Please see the discussion and links below for
additionanal information.</p>

<h2>Performance and Scalability</h2>

<p>The server is one of the <a href="fast.html">fastest</a> and <a
href="scalability.html">scalable</a> products we know of.  It's unique
<a href="modules.html">modular</a> design enables it to be stripped
down for embedded systems, or to expose all available features where
required.</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

<p>The server is currently running on a wide variety of <a
href="os.html">Operating Systems</a>.  It is tested to work on on
32-bit and 64-bit CPUs.</p>

<p>A large number of CPU and OS architectures are have been verified
to work, and are supported via the <a href="/list/users.html">users
list</a>.  We suggest that the server be installed via a pre-built
package if one is available.  If a package does not exist for your
system, it can be built from <a href="download.html">source</a>.</p>

<h2>AAA Functionality</h2>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>The server can <a href="authentication.html">authenticate</a> users
via simple methods (PAP, CHAP, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAP</a>, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAPv2</a>, SIP
Digest) and all common <a href="eap.html">EAP</a> types.</p>

<h3>Authorization</h3>

<h3>Accounting</h3>

<h2>RFC's and Vendor Dictionaries</h2>

<p>All RADIUS <a href="/rfc/">RFC's</a> are supported.  Over 100 <a
href="vendors.html">vendor dictionaries</a> are supported.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<h2>Virtual Servers</h2>

<p>FreeRADIUS is the only RADIUS server (commercial or Open Source)
that supports <a href="virtual_servers.html">virtual servers</a>.
This feature is similar to the virtual servers used in well-known web
servers such as Apache.  This feature can simplify complex
implementations, and can reduce ongoing support and maintenance
costs.</p>
