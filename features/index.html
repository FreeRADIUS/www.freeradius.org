<h1>List of Features</h1>

<p>The server has all features which are expected to be found in a
normal RADIUS server implementation.  In addition, it is unique among
Open Source RADIUS servers in it's support for <a
href="eap.html">EAP</a>.  It also has many capabilities not found in
any other RADIUS product, including commercial servers from large
vendors.</p>

<p>In short, if you need a certain feature, it is likely that
FreeRADIUS supports it.  Please see the discussion and links below for
additionanal information.</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

<p>The server is currently running on a wide variety of <a
href="os.html">Operating Systems</a>.  It is tested to work on on
32-bit and 64-bit CPUs.</p>

<p>A large number of CPU and OS architectures are have been verified
to work, and are supported via the <a href="/list/users.html">users
list</a>.  We suggest that the server be installed via a pre-built
package if one is available.  If a package does not exist for your
system, it can be built from <a href="download.html">source</a>.</p>

<h2>AAA Functionality</h2>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>The server can authenticate users via PAP, CHAP, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAP</a>, <a
href="http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.txt">MS-CHAPv2</a>, SIP
Digest, and all common <a href="eap.html">EAP</a> methods.</p>

<p>User passwords can be stored as clear-text, NT hashed (MD4), LM
hashed, MD5, salted-MD5, SHA1, salted-SHA1, or crypt
(e.g. <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>).  The <tt>pap</tt> module understands
passwords stored via the common LDAP method of using a header,
followed by password text.  (e.g. <tt>{header}text</tt>).  It
understands all commonly used header formats (<tt>{clear}</tt>,
<tt>{crypt}</tt>, etc.), and can parse the password text from
clear-text, a hex string, or a base-64 encoded string.</p>

<p>If a password is not available locally for some reason, the server
can pass the authentication to another system such as LDAP, PAM, Unix
(<tt>/etc/passwd</tt>), Kerberos, Active Directory, or RADIUS server
via RADIUS proxying.  Local programs (e.g. CGI scripts) can also be
used to authenticate users via shell scripts or any other method.
Perl or Python scripts can be pre-loaded into the server, which
significantly lowers the cost of running such programs.</p>

<h3>Authorization</h3>

<h3>Accounting</h3>

<h2>RFC's and Vendor Dictionaries</h2>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<h2>Scalability</h2>

<p>The server is designed with a "plug-in" module system.  Any feature
that is not needed can be removed from the configuration.  Once it is
removed from the configuration, it does not effect server performance,
memory use, etc.  This flexibility enables the server to run on
platforms ranging from embedded systems (e.g. LinkSys WRT54G) to
multi-core machines with gigabytes of RAM.  Only minor configuration
changes are necessary when scaling from small systems (one packet
every few seconds or minutes), to large systems (hundreds of threads,
and thousands of packets per second).</p>

<p>The server is currently deployed in many tier 1 ISPs and
telecommunications companies, as seen in the <a
href="/testimonials.html">testimonials</a> and <a
href="/press/survey.html">survey</a> pages.  There are many sites with
more than 10 million users who are using FreeRADIUS.  For some of
these, it is the <em>only</em> RADIUS server that they use.  As for
small sites (10 to 1000 users), nearly all of them use FreeRADIUS.</p>

<h2>Virtual Servers</h2>

<p>FreeRADIUS is the only RADIUS server (commercial or Open Source)
that supports <a href="virtual_servers.html">virtual servers</a>.
This feature is similar to the virtual servers used in well-known web
servers such as Apache.  This feature can simplify complex
implementations, and can reduce ongoing support and maintenance
costs.</p>
