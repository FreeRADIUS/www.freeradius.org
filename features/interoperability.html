<h1>Interoperability</h1>

<p>With the <a href="/press/survey.html#users">number of
deployments</a> of the server, we can say with confidence that the
server is interoperable with the widest possible range of devices and
operating systems.  In addition, we follow all available (and <a
href="/press/2007.html#rfc5080">lead</a>) <a href="/rfc/">RFC's</a>
and SDO specifications.</p>

<p>Given the Open Source nature of the server, most vendors test their
products with FreeRADIUS before shipping them to their customers.
This practice is recommended, as there are well over 50,000
deployments of the server.  It is very likely, therefore, that 
customer using FreeRADIUS will buy vendor equipment.  If the equipment
is not interoperable with FreeRADIUS, then those sales will be
lost.</p>

<p>There have been a number of cases in the past where a particular
vendor's product did not interoperate with the server.</p>

<p><center><em>In almost every case the product failed to implement
RADIUS correctly.</em></center></p>

<p>We recognize that there may be <a
href="http://bugs.freeradius.org">bugs</a> in the server.  However,
given the in-depth testing that the server receives before every
release, those bugs tend to be found quickly, and therefore
short-lived.</p>
