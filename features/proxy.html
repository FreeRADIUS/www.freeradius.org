<h1>Proxying</h1>

<p>The server can <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Proxy">proxy</a>
any request to other RADIUS servers.  Proxying can be done via the
common RADIUS <tt>realms</tt> method, which is completely under the
control of the local administrator.  Both prefixes and suffixes are
support, as are other arbitrary methods of selecting a realm.</p>

<p><a href="policy.html">Policies</a> can be executed before, and
after proxying.  This capability enables the administrator to re-write
requests before they are proxied, and also to re-write replies from
home servers.  For example, IP addresses may be assigned <a
href="ippool.html">locally</a>, so any IP address assignment received
from a home server needs to be deleted.</p>

<p>Home servers are grouped into pools, which permit multiple kinds of
fail-over and load-balancing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple fail-over.  The first home server is used, unless it is
down.  In which case the second is used, and so on.</li>

<li>Load-balancing.  Requests are split evenly among all home servers
in the pool.</li>

<li>Load-balancing by client.  Requests from a client are
automatically mapped to one home server by hashing the client IP
address.  There can be a different number of clients and home servers,
in which case many clients may map to one home server.</li>

<li>Load balancing by client port.  As above, except that the source
port is included in the hash calculation.</li>

<li>Keyed hashing.  Similar to the two previous methods, but the hash
key can be created dynamically by the administrator.  This
configuration permits, for example, EAP requests to be sent to one
home server, and all other authentication requests be sent to
another.</li>
</ul>
