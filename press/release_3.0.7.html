<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow coa home_servers to be derived from client
sections if a coa_server section is provided.
</li>
<li>Automatically determine the correct port if no port is
provided for a home server.
</li>
<li>Allow foreach to operate over lists.
</li>
<li>Add compile time features to ${feature.*} and versions
of core libraries to ${version.*}.  Feature and version
names match output of radiud -xv. %v is now deprecated.
</li>
<li>Add support for PATCH method in rlm_rest.
</li>
<li>Validate more module xlats on startup, and warn if an
xlat expansion is found in a double quoted config item
which will not be expanded.
</li>
<li>Add support for sub-second timeouts in rlm_rest.
</li>
<li>Add support for connection timeouts in rlm_rest.
</li>
<li>Add %{jsonquote:&lt;str&gt;} xlat to escape strings for insertion
into json documents.
</li>
<li>Add %{ldapquote:&lt;str&gt;} xlat to escape strings for insertion
into ldap DNs.
</li>
<li>Add %{explode:&amp;ref &lt;char&gt;}, splits value of &amp;ref on
&lt;char&gt; and creates new &amp;ref type attributes with the
fragments.
</li>
<li>Allow rlm_ldap to use attribute references for base_dn and
filter config items. The attribute references are not
escaped, allowing DNs and filters to be created dynamically.
</li>
<li>Add %{nexttime:[&lt;int&gt;]h|d|w|y} to calculate the number of
seconds before the next &lt;int&gt; hour(s), day(s), week(s),
or year(s).
</li>
<li>Allow the left side of update sections to be xlat expansions.
The result of the expansion is then used to reference the
attribute to be modified.
</li>
<li>Added %{lpad:&amp;Attribute-Name 7 x} and rpad.  These produce
fixed-width output strings, with padding to the left (lpad)
or the right (rpad).
</li>
<li>For some SQL drivers (MySQL, sqlite) distinguish between
constraints violations (on insert), invalid queries, and
server errors, and return noop, invalid, and error respectively.
</li>
<li>Call SHOW WARNINGS in the MySQL driver and write them to
the request log, if libmysqlclient indicates warnings are
available on the server.
</li>
<li>Forbid the creation of Vendor-Specific for non-standard
VSAs.  Use Attr-26 = 0x... instead.
</li>
<li>Make dhcpclient work with raw sockets and various other
improvements - Contributed by nchaigne
</li>
<li>Add support for SSHA2 - Contributed by PDD.
</li>
<li>Add perle dictionary - Contributed by Hachmer
</li>
<li>Modernise init scripts for RHEL, SUSE and Debian.
</li>
<li>radmin now tracks the return code of commands, and exits
with status &quot;1&quot; if any command failed to execute.
</li>
<li>radmin now sends error messages from the server to
stderr, instead of to stdout.
</li>
<li>radmin now looks for sockets matching it's UID and GID,
rather than just always using the first one it finds.
</li>
<li>radmin can how delete clients which are tied to a listener.
</li>
<li>Moved RADIUS attribute definitions to src/include/rfc*.h
</li>
<li>Move to talloc pools for requests.  For in-memory tests
(default config, 'users' file), performance increases by 30%.
</li>
<li>In rlm_ldap allow sasl_mech to be specified for admin and
user binds. Only non-interactive mechs (like EXTERNAL)
are currently supported.
</li>
<li>Remove support for ephemeral RSA keys.  They were &quot;export only&quot;,
and should not be used by anyone.
</li>
<li>Syntax errors in the &quot;users&quot; file now produce better
error messages.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix issues parsing LDAP hostnames with non-standard ports.
</li>
<li>Fix issues with realms containing regular expressions.
</li>
<li>Allow unary negation before parantheses in rlm_expr.
</li>
<li>Fix infinite loop in kevent event loop code. Issue only
presented on FreeBSD.
</li>
<li>Be more careful to define Auth-Types before loading modules.
</li>
<li>Link libfreeradius-radius against OpenSSL too, to avoid
multi-version symbols in SSL libraries.
</li>
<li>When rlm_ldap rebinds a connection, it should use bind
credentials from the module that created the connection
pool, not credentials from the module referencing it.
</li>
<li>Empty server config pairs should be allowed in rlm_ldap
instances that reference another module's connection pool.
</li>
<li>Mark rlm_always as huppable, so its rcode can be changed
via radmin (allows policy toggles).
</li>
<li>Emit warnings when ignoring user configured pool values.
</li>
<li>Fix issue that would cause radclient to complain
intermittently about differing numbers of filters and
requests.
</li>
<li>Fix cosmetic issues in connection pool logging, that made
it appear as if the same connection was being opened
multiple times.
</li>
<li>Fix threadsafety issues in SQL drivers, where a static
buffer was used to store error messages.
</li>
<li>Log RERROR, RWARN, RINFO to the global log if request
logging is not enabled.
</li>
<li>Link to libldap instead of libldap_r. libldap_r
is not supported for use by projects outside of OpenLDAP.
</li>
<li>Set connection timeout correctly in rlm_sql_mysql.
</li>
<li>Build with older versions of libcurl, and use CFLAGS from
curl-config.
</li>
<li>Honour Packet-Src-Port and Packet-Src-IP-address in radclient.
</li>
<li>Initialise ldapai_info_version field, so libldap will report
its vendor and version.
</li>
<li>Fix log rotation scripts by using the copyrotate option.
</li>
<li>Fix issue that caused opening control sockets to always
fail on non-Linux systems, if a user or group was set.
</li>
<li>Save Session-State after proxying.
</li>
<li>Additional fixes for reading CoA/DM requests from detail
files.
</li>
<li>Create dynamic clients if the dynamic clients virtual server
returns ok *or* updated. Emit useful messages for other codes.
</li>
<li>Compile bare &quot;authorize&quot; statements, and issue errors saying
using them isn't a good idea.
</li>
</ul>
