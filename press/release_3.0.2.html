<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>secret keys and LDAP / SQL passwords are now printed as
&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;&lt;&lt;&lt; secret &gt;&gt;&gt;&#39; in debugging mode.  Use -Xx to see the
actual passwords.
</li>
<li>Print out more information about passwords in -Xx,
including hashes, comparisons, etc.
</li>
<li>Allow cast (and implicit conversion) of integers to IPv4 addresses
</li>
<li>More xlats allow attribute references.  This means they can
operate on binary data.  e.g. expr, base64, md5, sha1.
</li>
<li>Added more tests.
</li>
<li>The dictionaries are now auto-loaded.  raddb/dictionary
should no longer have $INCLUDE ${prefix}/share/dictionary
</li>
<li>A &quot;panic_action&quot; can be set to have the server dump a gdb
log on SEGV or other fatal error.  See radiusd.conf
</li>
<li>Add support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 to rlm_pap.
</li>
<li>Add &quot;%{sha256:}&quot; and &quot;%{sha512:}&quot; xlat functions.
</li>
<li>Cache CUI in EAP session resumption.
</li>
<li>templates can now have sub-sections, which will be included
in the section referencing the template.
</li>
<li>Update more dictionaries.
</li>
<li>Added more instances of the &quot;always&quot; module, for all return
codes.
</li>
<li>Suppress broken NASes when proxying.  Retransmits which occur
more than once per second are rate-limited to once per second.
</li>
<li>Allow &#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;&amp;&#39; in more xlat expansions.
</li>
<li>Update PostgreSQL schema and queries to record last updated
time, and accounting interim.
</li>
<li>Optimize more &quot;if&quot; conditions when the server loads.  This will
avoid work at run time.  e.g. (&quot;foo&quot; == &quot;bar&quot;) --&gt; FALSE.
</li>
<li>Allow removal of all attributes within a list with !* operator.
</li>
<li>Allow list to list copies with request qualifiers (outer.).
</li>
<li>Add support for ipv4 prefixes and ipv6 addresses and prefixes to
%{integer:}.
</li>
<li>allow radmin command &quot;set module status &lt;module&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;
which can be used to forcibly enable/disable modules.
</li>
<li>pap module now assumes Cleartext-Password if Password-With-Header
doesn&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;t have a {...} header.
</li>
<li>Added &quot;unpack&quot; module.  It can unpack binary data from horrible
VSA formats.  See raddb/mods-available/unpack
</li>
<li>Added example IP Pool for DHCP, using sqlite.  From Matthew Newton
See raddb/mods-config/sql/ippool-dhcp/
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix SQL groups.
</li>
<li>Fix operation of fr_strerror() with RE*() macros.
</li>
<li>Don&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;t assert if the connection we&#39;re trying to reconnect
is not in_use.
</li>
<li>Fix %{mschap:User-Name} xlat.
</li>
<li>Allow comparisons of signed integers and of ethernet addresses.
</li>
<li>Fix parsing of text-based ascend binary filters.
</li>
<li>Fix a few minor Coverity and clang analyzer issues.
</li>
<li>Log WARNING and ERROR prefixes only once, not twice.
</li>
<li>Fix attribute truncation seen in Perl and other places.
</li>
<li>Use correct port when DHCP relaying.
</li>
<li>Fix behaviour on FreeBSD where sending packets from an interface
bound to an IP address would fail when the server was built with
udpfromto.
</li>
<li>Don&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;t abort() when freeing home servers on exit.
</li>
<li>Fix edge case in pairmove() when some attributes could be over-
written.
</li>
<li>Do checks for individual sqlite v2 functions so rlm_sqlite builds
correctly with more versions of the library.
</li>
<li>In heimdal kerberos, create MEMORY ccaches on a per context basis.
This prevents issues with the root ccache being used.
</li>
<li>Fix corner case with proxying, where home server goes down.
</li>
<li>Rate-limit &quot;max_requests&quot; complaint.  We don&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;t want to fill the
logs when something goes wrong.
</li>
<li>Use /dev/urandom for raddb/certs/random, if it exists.
</li>
<li>Issue WARNING that old-style clients should no longer be used.
</li>
<li>Auto-set secret to &quot;radsec&quot; for tcp+tls home servers.
</li>
<li>Fix double free in home_server_add when there is a parse error
on startup.
</li>
<li>rlm_unix checks if the dictionaries are broken, instead of crashing
</li>
<li>Fix potential memory corruption when normalising salted password
hashes from hex, where the combined hash and salt was &gt; 64 bytes.
</li>
<li>Register sqlcounter attributes correctly, and other issues with it
</li>
<li>treat 127.0.0.1/32 as being identical to 127.0.0.1
</li>
<li>Don&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;t mangle error output of SQL drivers like PostgreSQL
</li>
<li>Fix usage of &quot;tls = ${tls}&quot;.  It could previously cause problems
when the reference was used multiple times.
</li>
<li>Fix TLS session leak for incoming sockets.
</li>
<li>Try harder to clean up memory on exit when using &quot;-mM&quot;
</li>
<li>Fix memory leak when home server is down for RadSec connections
</li>
<li>rate-limit outgoing connection attempts when the home server
is down.  It will retry no more than once per second.
</li>
<li>When parsing ipv6 address prefixes, always mask off the host
portion.
</li>
<li>Fix rlm_counter so that it does not create two reply
attributes.
</li>
<li>Fix issues with DHCP Sub-TLVs where the value of the first
Sub-TLV would appear corrupted, and subsequent TLVs would
not appear in debug output.
</li>
<li>Initialize scope in IP address parsing
</li>
<li>Prevent vendor attributes and RFC space attributes from clashing
in rlm_attr_filter.
</li>
<li>Set source IP address for DHCP packets from DHCP-Server-IP-Address,
or DHCP-DHCP-Server-Identifier, if we&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;re unable to otherwise
determine the source IP.
</li>
<li>Fix POST attribute parsing in rlm_rest.
</li>
<li>Fix JSON attribute parsing in rlm_rest.
</li>
<li>Don&#<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/39">39</a>;t append trailing &amp; to POST options in rlm_rest (minor).
</li>
<li>Process HTTP 100 Continue messages correctly in rlm_rest
</li>
<li>Fix generation of long &gt; 512 byte POST payloads, where attribute
values on the chunk boundary may have been omitted in rlm_rest.
</li>
<li>Remove duplicate escape sequence parsing in rlm_sqlippool and
rlm_sqlcounter which caused issues with escaping %. Escape
sequence parsing is now handled purely by the xlat functions.
</li>
<li>Ensure %% is treated as a string literal, and so not passed to any
xlat escape functions for processing.
</li>
<li>Correct calculation of Message-Authenticator
for CoA packets.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/556">556</a>
</li>
</ul>
