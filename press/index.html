<dt><span class="date">20 July 2009</span> We have worked with MySQL to
create two white papers on MySQL scalability and MySQL cluster.  They
are now available:</dt>

<ul>
<b>Delivering Scalable & Highly Available AAA Services</b>

<p>This white paper discusses the concepts of current data storage
solutions for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
environments and their potential limitations as network use grows and
services become more dynamic.

<p>The paper then presents an alternative deployment scenario based on
the FreeRADIUS Server and MySQL Cluster serving as the back-end AAA
database, providing an infrastructure for high growth and
availability, with low complexity. A sizing study and user case study
are presented to demonstrate how the solution performs in real-world
FreeRADIUS environments</p>

<b>Deployment Guide: FreeRADIUS with the MySQL Cluster Database</b>

<p>This Guide documents a best-practice approach to configuring and
testing a FreeRADIUS server deployed with the MySQL Cluster database
storage engine serving as the back-end data store for user and
accounting data. Deployment topologies and configurations are
presented, enabling users to quickly and simply replicate the solution
in their own environment.</p>
