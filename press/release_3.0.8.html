<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
      * Allow syslog_severity to be set in rlm_linelog.
<li>Allow defaults to be set for bulk clients in LDAP and couchbase.
</li>
<li>Updates to dhcpclient.  Patches from Nicolas C.
</li>
<li>rlm_mschap now supports direct connections to winbind, which
is faster than ntlm_auth.  See raddb/mods-available/mschap.
Patch from Matthew Newton.
</li>
<li>Recommend /dev/urandom for TLS randomness, instead of
${certdir}/random
</li>
<li>Allow TLSv1 to be disabled via &quot;disable_tlsv1&quot; in tls{}.
</li>
<li>Allow Expanded EAP types where vendor is 0 (IETF) and
type is normal EAP type.  Supplicants sending Expanded
EAP types like this are broken.
</li>
<li>Add support for server side sort controls when searching for
user objects in rlm_ldap.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't complain about &quot;authorize&quot; in &quot;server {}&quot; blocks, but
only if there's no &quot;server&quot; block.
</li>
<li>Fix cosmetic issue where debug from the first packet read by
a detail reader thread would be emited during config parsing.
</li>
<li>Fix ASSERT on truncated detail packets.
</li>
<li>Don't use main server log functions from within panic_action,
as in the case of syslog this would cause deadlocks if the
fault was triggered from within a malloc.
</li>
<li>Fix issue in &quot;switch&quot; when &quot;correct_escapes = false&quot;.
Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/911">911</a>.
</li>
<li>Fix sqlcounter configuration to use &quot;%%b&quot; instead of &quot;%b&quot;,
otherwise the new syntax validation will fail.
</li>
<li>Allow forward references in configuration items.  Modules
aren't always loaded in a sane order.
</li>
<li>Fix more escaping issues.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/912">912</a>.
</li>
<li>Decode MAC addresses correctly for VMPS.
</li>
<li>Fix memory leak with TLS connections.
</li>
<li>Fix state machine threading issues for conflicting packets.
</li>
<li>Fix copy_request_to_tunnel issues for tagged attributes.
</li>
<li>Allow &quot;ok&quot; to over-ride &quot;updated&quot; inside of Auth-Type sections.
</li>
<li>Update state machine so that post-proxy is run though child
threads for performance, instead of blocking the main thread.
</li>
<li>Allow &quot;netmask&quot; to work again in client definitions.
</li>
<li>Relax restrictions on SQL group queries.
</li>
<li>track outgoing proxy sockets and clean them up more aggressively.
</li>
<li>track proxy statistics, including CoA and Disconnect.
</li>
<li>If radmin has a connection failure when running a command,
it re-connects and runs the command again.
</li>
<li>mark home servers &quot;unknown&quot; less aggressively.
</li>
<li>Fix potential SEGV in PostgreSQL driver on error.
</li>
<li>Fix issue where fields like nas_type would not be accessible via
the %{client:} xlat, for dynamic clients.
</li>
<li>Set default busy_timeout (of 200ms) in the sqlite driver, so writes
don't cause selects to fail in multithreaded mode. This is user
configurable, and may be increased if required.
</li>
<li>Convert Password-With-Header attributes to binary (from hex or
base64), in the authorize method of rlm_pap.
</li>
<li>Fix invalid assert in state.c, that could cause abort in
post-auth.
</li>
<li>Fix double free when -m flag is used, and connection pools are
referenced by multiple modules.
</li>
<li>RADIUS over TLS accounting uses the same port as authentication.
</li>
<li>Regularized return codes from radmin commands.
</li>
<li>Fix RHEL spec file so it works correctly for Centos7 which uses
systemd, and didn't like the SystemV init script.
</li>
<li>radwho and radlast now have a -D option to load dictionaries
</li>
<li>DHCP packets are no longer checked for duplicates.
</li>
<li>Don't crash in sql module group comparisons in corner case.
</li>
<li>Calculate MPPE keys correctly when using TLS 1.2.
</li>
<li>Fix load-balance sections.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/945">945</a>
</li>
<li>TLS certificates are available again in the post-auth section.
They are not available for session resumption.
</li>
<li>radclient encodes CHAP-Password properly when using -c.
Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/955">955</a>.
</li>
<li>Fix issue in rlm_cache_memcached driver that caused variable
length values to be truncated.
</li>
<li>Fix track functionality in detail reader, so it no longer
fails with a &quot;Failed marking detail request as done: Bad file
descriptor&quot; error.
</li>
<li>Actually add the peer identity (as User-Name) to the inner
tunnel in EAP-PWD requests, so it's available for lookups.
</li>
<li>Fixes to PostfreSQL queries.  Patches from Santiago Gimeno.
</li>
</ul>
