<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>radmin / raddebug conditional errors are printed
to the output, instead of being discarded.
</li>
<li>raddebug will exit if condition set with -c was invalid.
</li>
<li>radmin auto-reconnects if the connection to the server
has gone away.
</li>
<li>rlm_cache now has submodule support.  See
raddb/mods-available/cache
</li>
<li>New memcached driver for rlm_cache. See
raddb/mods-available/cache
</li>
<li>Add support for &amp;Attribute-Name[*] in conditions.
See &quot;man unlang&quot; for details.
</li>
<li>Add &amp;Attribute-Name[n] which gets the last instance
of an attribute e.g. Module-Failure-Message[n].
</li>
<li>Allow for redundant string expansions.  See the
&quot;instantiate&quot; section of radiusd.conf.
</li>
<li>When checking IP addresses in conditions, make the
right side be parsed as an IP prefix.
</li>
<li>Support JIT compilation of compiled regular expressions
when built with libpcre.
</li>
<li>Support named capture groups with &quot;%{regex:&lt;name&gt;}&quot;
when built with libpcre.
</li>
<li>Increase regular expression capture groups from 8 to 32.
</li>
<li>Emit error markers for badly formed regular expressions.
</li>
<li>Allow 'm' flag to enable multiline mode in regular
expressions.
</li>
<li>Support limited implicit attribute conversion in update
sections.
</li>
<li>Support casting between IPv6 and IPv4 where the IPv6
address has the v4/v6 mapping prefix (::ffff:).
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>PEAP works again.  As does proxying EAP-MSCHAPv2
from inside of a PEAP tunnel.
</li>
<li>&quot;group&quot; is allowed inside of &quot;instantiate&quot; sections.
</li>
<li>update disconnect {} with
disconnect:Packet-Dst-IP-Address now works correctly.
</li>
<li>Regular expression comparisons of non string attributes
are now disallowed in the files module.  Previously
they would silently fail or produce undefined behaviour.
</li>
<li>Fix parsing of old regular expressions.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/842">842</a>
</li>
<li>Fix off by one error in ascend filters.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/843">843</a>.
</li>
<li>Handle NT-Hash in rlm_pap.  This allows passwords to
have backslashes in them.
</li>
<li>Fix infinite loop on &quot;Fall-Through = yes&quot; when
processing SQL groups.
</li>
<li>Correct the check of SQL query return code.
</li>
<li>Run &quot;Post-Auth-Type Reject&quot; if the request was rejected
in post-auth
</li>
<li>Write &quot;Login OK&quot; only if the post-auth section passed.
</li>
<li>Create TLS-Cert-* certificates, even when EAP session
caching is disabled.
</li>
<li>Finalize the &quot;correct_escapes&quot; with many more tests.
</li>
<li>Move to the new OpenLDAP libldap API, fixes more issues
with binary values.
</li>
<li>Fix potential memory corruption in rlm_ldap if start
connections were set to 0, and the server was running
in threaded mode. The fix is a workaround for an issue
in libldap and was suggested by Howard Chu.
</li>
<li>Give parse errors on &quot;%{...&quot;, without the closing brace.
</li>
<li>Allow spaces in certificate passwords for build rules
in raddb/certs//
</li>
<li>Make all regular expression evaluation binary safe.
Where that's not possible, emit an error if the pattern
or subject contains an embedded null byte.
</li>
<li>Fix various issues around masking IPv6 addresses.
</li>
<li>Give descriptive error if unknown attributes are used
in &quot;update&quot; sections.
</li>
<li>Deal with cases where ldap_initialize isn't available
gracefully, and use it exclusively when it's available.
</li>
</ul>
