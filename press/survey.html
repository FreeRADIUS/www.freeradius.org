<h1>Why We're #1</h1>

<p>We recently commissioned a survey of FreeRADIUS users, in order to
see how people are using the server.  The survey was commissioned
because RADIUS servers are usally hidden inside of private networks
(for very good reasons), and are not publicly accessibly like HTTP or
DNS servers.  That is, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>
can say that it is the number one HTTP server in the Internet because
of public results from <a
href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html">Netcraft</a>.
In order to get the same data, have to go ask site administrators
about their current deployments.</p>

<p>The good news is that over 500 responses to the survey were
received, with the results summarized below.</p>

<h2>Number of Users authenticated via FreeRADIUS</h2>

<tr><td valign="top" width="75%">
<p>Most sites using FreeRADIUS are intermediate in size, and are
probably running the server in enterprise (i.e. corporate)
environments, or in small ISPs.  Over 90% of the sites have less than
100,000 users.</p>

<p>The interesting data point, though, is that there are a small
percentage of sites have over 10,000,000 (10 <b>MILLION</b>) users.
When we add up the numbers, the total is almost 100,000,000 users who
are authenticated via FreeRADIUS.  And that only includes the sites
that filled out the survey!</p>

<p>When we take into account the other results of the survey, our best
estimate is that FreeRADIUS is responsible for authenticating
somewhere between 25% and 50% of the users on the Internet.  The rest
of the users are split into two roughly equal parts: Cisco ACS and
Microsoft IAS (each with an equal share); and all of the other RADIUS
servers combined.</p>
