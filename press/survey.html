<h1>Why We're #1</h1>

<p>We recently commissioned a survey of FreeRADIUS users, in order to
see how people are using the server.  The survey was commissioned
because RADIUS servers are usally hidden inside of private networks
(for very good reasons), and are not publicly accessibly like HTTP or
DNS servers.  That is, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>
can say that it is the number one HTTP server in the Internet because
of public results from <a
href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html">Netcraft</a>.
In order to get the same data, we have to go ask site administrators
what they are using.</p>

<p>The good news is that over 500 responses to the survey were
received, with the results as of November 2006 summarized below.<p>

<a name="users"></a>
<h2>Number of Users authenticated via FreeRADIUS</h2>

<table border=0>
<tr><td valign="top" width="75%">
<p>Most sites using FreeRADIUS are intermediate in size, and are
probably running the server in enterprise (i.e. corporate)
environments, or in small ISPs.  Over 90% of the sites have less than
100,000 users.</p>

<p>The most interesting result is that there are a small percentage of
sites have over 10,000,000 (that's 10 <b>MILLION</b>) users.  When we
add up all of the sites, the total comes to about 100,000,000 users
who are authenticated via FreeRADIUS.  And that number includes only
the sites that filled out the survey!</p>

<p>Taking into account the <a href="#others">other results</a>, our
best estimate is that FreeRADIUS is responsible for authenticating at
least <em>one third of the users on the Internet</em>.  The rest of
the users are split into two roughly equal parts: Cisco ACS and
Microsoft IAS (each with an equal share); and all of the other RADIUS
servers combined.</p>

<a name="servers"></a>
<h2>How many RADIUS servers are at each site</h2>

<table border=0>
<tr><td valign="top" width="66%">

<p>Not surprisingly, most sites have a very small number of servers.  A
few sites (likely the biggest ones) have a large number of servers.</p>

<p>It looks like most sites under 10000 users have one or two servers.
As the number of users grows, so does the number of servers used.  A
few sites have more than 50 servers, likely because they are placing
servers at multiple locations.</p>

<a name="databases"></a>
<h2>Databases where user information is stored.</h2>

<table border=0>
<tr><td valign="top" width="66%">

<p>Taken together the various SQL modules account for nearly 50% of
deployments.  The only surprise is that Active Directory has such a
low ranking, as it is the database used in most internal corporate
(i.e. enterprise) environments.  The conclusion that we can reach from
this is that the people filling out this survey are probably ISP's and
resellers rather than enterprise IT administrators.</p>

<p>Another conclusion is that if you have to store a few million users
in a database, Active Directory probably isn't your first choice.</p>

</td><td valign="top">

<a name="protocols"></a>
<h2>Authentication Protocols</h2>

<table border=0>
<tr><td valign="top" width="66%">

<p>Most sites are using RADIUS for dial-in user authentication.
e.g. Telephone dial-up, ADSL, etc.  The number of wireless deployments
is large, though, at just over a third.  We expect that there will be
more new wireless deployments in the future.</p>

<p>While we haven't broken the numbers out here, PEAP, EAP-TLS, and
EAP-TTLS all have about the same share of the wireless space.</p>

</td><td valign="top">
<table border=1 align="right">
<caption>Authentication Protocols</caption>
<tr>
<td>PAP, etc.</td>
<td>61%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wireless&nbsp;(EAP)</td>
<td>35%</td>

<tr>
<td>Digest (VOIP)</td>
<td>4%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table> <!-- float fixes -->

<a name="others"></a>
<h2>Other RADIUS Servers</h2>

<table border=0>
<tr><td valign="top" width="66%">

<p>Not everyone uses FreeRADIUS, so we also asked what other RADIUS
servers people have used.<p>

<p>As mentioned <a href="#users">above</a>, ACS and IAS have about an
equal market share, and together account for about 50% of other
servers.  Anther 40% is shared pretty much equally between a few
well-known RADIUS servers.  The last 10% is a jumble of old servers
(some <em>very</em> old), or servers that are targetted towards niche
markets.</p>

<p>The numbers for Funk and Radiator are probably too low, because the
survey was focussed on sites that have chosen to deploy Open Source.
For the same reasons mentioned <a href="#databases">before</a>, we
expect that enterprises who have chosen to use a commercial product
have also not filled out the survey.</p>
