<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Documentation for upgrading from 2.x is in raddb/README.rst
Please follow it.  It will make the upgrade easier.
</li><li>Moved configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more sense.
</li><li>Added the "integer64" and "ipv4prefix" data types.
</li><li>Added RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec). See raddb/sites-available/tls
</li><li>Updated internal API to support new attributes and formats
</li><li>Added code to send SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.
</li><li>Added preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
</li><li>Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
See raddb/dictionary for more details.
</li><li>Added packet/s tracking. See max_pps in the "listen" section.
</li><li>The %{} expansions and "unlang" conditions are now parsed at server
start. Descriptive errors are produced for syntax and format errors.
</li><li>Casting is now supported for "unlang" comparisons.  See "man unlang"
e.g. <ipaddr>127.0.0.1 == Framed-IP-Address.
</li><li>Direct comparison of attribute references is now supported.
e.g. &Foo == &Bar.  This avoids stringification of the attributes.
</li><li>Direct assignment of attributes is now supported.
e.g. Foo := &Bar.  It also works for "octets" data types.
</li><li>Comparisons of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes are now supported.
The "<" operator means "within the prefix" for comparisons.
</li><li>New sha1 xlat expansion (thanks to Alan Buxey)
</li><li>Colourised log messages when logging to stdout.  Look for yellow
warnings and red errors.  Doing this will save you a LOT of grief.
</li><li>If the PCRE library is available, use it (insted of the POSIX
functions) to process regular expressions (thanks to Phil Mayers).
</li><li>-xv now displays all the features the server was built with, and
the versions of the core libraries (libtalloc, libssl).
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Module Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available/, and raddb/mods-enabled/,
following the examples of other projects.
</li><li>Additional files for each module are now in raddb/mods-config/.
See raddb/mods-config/README.rst for documentation.
</li><li>Moved "users" to raddb/mods-config/files/authorize
</li><li>Moved "hints" and "huntgroups" to raddb/mods-config/preprocess/
</li><li>Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
</li><li>Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
</li><li>Moved TLS configuration for EAP into a common subsection.
See raddb/mods-available/eap, "tls-config" section.
</li><li>Added for MS-CHAP Change Password from Phil Mayers.
See raddb/mods-available/mschap, "passchange" subsection.
</li><li>Added EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
</li><li>Added connection pools for modules. This unifies connection
management which was previously different for different modules.
</li><li>SQL now uses the connection pool.  See mods-available/sql
</li><li>SQL now supports arbitrary Acct-Status-Types.
These changes are not compatible with 2.x.
</li><li>SQL now has full support for SQLite.  See raddb/sql/main/sqlite/
</li><li>SQLite supports auto-creation of new databases on server startup for
bootstrapping purposes.
</li><li>LDAP now uses the connection pool.  The LDAP module has been
completely re-written for performance and simplicity.
</li><li>LDAP now caches groups.  This makes multiple group checks MUCH
faster.
</li><li>Removed all limitations on 253 octet attributes.  RFC 6929 allows
for attributes up to 4K in length.
</li><li>New rlm_idn module providing an expansion for performing IDNA encoding
	of internationalized domain names.  Thanks to 'skids'.
</li><li>New rlm_yubikey module to validate yubikey OTP tokens.
See raddb/modules/yubikey
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Internal API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>All traces of the old build system have been removed.
The new build system is faster and simpler.
</li><li>clang is fully supported.
</li><li>We now use "talloc" for memory management.  A number of new
features required this change.  Thanks to the Samba people!
</li><li>Many internal APIs have been updated to use talloc.
</li><li>New API for iterating over VALUE_PAIRs.  This is in preparation
for attributes, in version 3.1.
</li><li>No new code should directly modify any field of a VALUE_PAIR.
</li><li>VALUE_PAIRs contain pointers to DICT_ATTR instead of containing
attribute and vendor fields.  This will allow nested attributes.
</li><li>Some protocol specific code has been moved out into proto_* modules.
More will come in subsequent versions.  See proto_dhcp and proto_vmps.
</li><li>Standardised internal logging macros.  radlog() should not be used.
See src/include/log.h
</li><li>Use OpenSSL hashing functions when available.
</li><li>The server now builds with no warnings on most platforms.
</li><li>New RADIUS encoder/decoder, to support new formats.
</li><li>Added RFC 6929 "extended attributes", via the new encoder/decoder.
</li><li>Added full WiMAX support, via the new encoder/decoder.  The old
code could not handle some unusual corner cases.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
</li><li>All known bug fixes from 2.2.x are included.
</li><li>Removed "addport" functionality.
</li><li>Removed many unused or duplicate modules.  See raddb/README.rst.
</li>
</ul>
