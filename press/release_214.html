<h3>Feature Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Permit multiple "-e" in radmin.</li>
<li>Add support for originating CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request. See raddb/sites-available/originate-coa.</li>
<li>Added "lifetime" and "max_queries" to raddb/sql.conf. This helps address the problem of hung SQL sockets.</li>
<li>Allow packets to be injected via radmin.  See "inject help" in radmin.</li>
<li>Answer VMPS reconfirmation request.  Patch from Hermann Lauer.</li>
<li>Sample logrotate script in scripts/logrotate.freeradius</li>
<li>Add configurable poll interval for "detail" listeners</li>
<li>New "raddebug" command.  This prints debugging information from a running server.  See <a href="radiusd/man/raddebug.html">man raddebug</a>.</li>
<li>Add "require_message_authenticator" configuration to home_server configuration.  This makes the server add Message-Authenticator to all outgoing Access-Request packets.</li>
<li>Added smsotp module, as contributed by Siemens.</li>
<li>Enabled the administration socket in the default install. See raddb/sites-available/control-socket, and <a href="radiusd/man/radmin">man radmin</a></li>
<li>Handle duplicate clients, such as with replicated or load-balanced SQL servers and "readclients = yes"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clean up control sockets when they are closed, so that we don't leak memory.
<li>Define SUN_LEN for systems that don't have it.</li>
<li>Correct some boundary conditions in the conditional checker ("if") in "unlang".  Bug noted by Arran Cudbard-Bell.</li>
<li>Work around minor building issues in gmake.  This should only have affected developers.</li>
<li>Change how we manage unprivileged user/group, so that we do not create control sockets owned by root.</li>
<li>Fixed more minor issues found by Coverity.</li>
<li>Allow raddb/certs/bootstrap to run when there is no "make" command installed.</li>
<li>In radiusd.conf, run_dir depends on the name of the program, and isn't hard-coded to "..../radiusd"</li>
<li>Check for EOF in more places in the "detail" file reader.</li>
<li>Added Freeswitch dictionary.</li>
<li>Chop ethernet frames in VMPS, rather than droppping packets.</li>
<li>Fix EAP-TLS bug.  Patch from Arnaud Ebalard</li>
<li>Don't lose string for regex-compares in the "users" file.</li>
<li>Expose more functions in rlm_sql to rlm_sqlippool, which  helps on systems where RTLD_GLOBAL is off.</li>
<li>Fix typos in MySQL schemas for ippools.</li>
<li>Remove macro that was causing build issues on some platforms.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with dead home servers.  Bug noted by Chris Moules.</li>
<li>Fixed "access after free" with some dynamic clients.</li>
</ul>
