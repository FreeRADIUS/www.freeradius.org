<h3>Feature Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>radclient exits with 0 on successful (accept / ack), and 1 otherwise (no response / reject)</li>
<li>Added support for %{sql:UPDATE ..}, and insert/delete.  Patch from Arran Cudbard-Bell</li>
<li>Added sample "do not respond" policy.  See raddb/policy.conf and raddb/sites-available/do_not_respond</li>
<li>Cleanups to Suse spec file from Norbert Wegener</li>
<li>New VSAs for Juniper from Bjorn Mork</li>
<li>Include more RFC dictionaries in the default install</li>
<li>More documentation for the WiMAX module</li>
<li>Added "chase_referrals" and "rebind" configuration to rlm_ldap. This helps with Active Directory.  See raddb/modules/ldap</li>
<li>Don't load pre/post-proxy if proxying is disabled.</li>
<li>Added %{md5:...}, which returns MD5 hash in hex.</li>
<li>Added configurable "retry_interval" and "poll_interval" for "detail" listeners.</li>
<li>Added "delete_mppe_keys" configuration option to rlm_wimax.  Apparently some WiMAX clients misbehave when they see those keys.</li>
<li>Added experimental rlm_ruby from <a href="http://github.com/Antti/freeradius-server/tree/master">http://github.com/Antti/freeradius-server/tree/master</a></li>
<li>Add Tunnel attributes to ldap.attrmap</li>
<li>Enable virtual servers to be reloaded on HUP.  For now, only the "authorize", "authenticate", etc. processing sections are reloaded.  Clients and "listen" sections are NOT reloaded.</li>
<li>Updated "radwatch" script to be more robust.  See scripts/radwatch</li>
<li>Added certificate compatibility notes in raddb/certs/README, for compatibility with different operating systems. (i.e. Windows)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minor changes to allow building without VQP.</li>
<li>Minor fixes from John Center</li>
<li>Fixed raddebug example</li>
<li>Don't crash when deleting attributes via unlang</li>
<li>Be friendlier to very fast clients</li>
<li>Updated the "detail" listener so that it only polls once, and not many times in a row, leaking memory each time...</li>
<li>Update comparison for Packet-Src-IP-Address (etc.) so that the operators other than '==' work.</li>
<li>Did autoconf magic to work around weird libtool bug</li>
<li>Make rlm_perl keep tags for tagged attributes in more situations</li>
<li>Update UID checking for radmin</li>
<li>Added "include_length" field for TTLS.  It's needed for RFC compliance, but not (apparently) for interoperability.</li>
</ul>
