<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everything now builds with no warnings from the C compiler,
clang static analyzer, or cppcheck.
</li>
<li>rlm_ldap now supports defining the LDAP attribute name via
backticked expansion (i.e. shell command) in
RADIUS &lt;-&gt; LDAP mappings.
</li>
<li>rlm_ldap now supports older style generic attributes.
</li>
<li>dynamic expansions (e.g. &quot;%{expr:1 + 2}&quot; are now parsed
when the server starts.  Syntax errors in the strings
are caught, and a descriptive error is printed.
</li>
<li>Static regular expressions (e.g. /a*b/) are now parsed
when the server starts.  Syntax errors in the strings
are caught, and a descriptive error is printed.
</li>
<li>dynamic expansions are cached after being parsed.  They are
no longer re-parsed at run-time for every request.
</li>
<li>regular expressions are now parsed and cached when the server
starts.
</li>
<li>Added the %{rest:} expansion to rlm_rest, which will send
a GET request to the URL passed as the format string.
Any body text will be written to the expansion buffer.
</li>
<li>rlm_rest now available as a debian package.
</li>
<li>When an 'if' condition statically evaluates to true/false,
unlang does more static optimization.  For examples, see
src/tests/keywords/if-skip
</li>
<li>All modules are marked as safe for '-C', which lets the
dynamic expansion checks work in more situations.
</li>
<li>Added 'none' and 'custom' rlm_rest body types. 'custom'
allows sending of arbitrary expanded text and content-type
headers.
</li>
<li>Added "config" section to Perl.  See mods-available/perl
</li>
<li>Added '%v' which expands to the server version - Patch
from Alan Buxey.
</li>
<li>more mis-matched casts are caught in "if" conditions,
and descriptive errors are printed.
</li>
<li>Support basic response validation in radclient. This allows
administrators to write local test cases for their
site-specific configurations.
</li>
<li>Removed radconf2xml and radmin "show client config" and
"show home_server config".
</li>
<li>Forbid running with vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
See "allow_vulnerable_openssl" in the "security"
subsection of "radiusd.conf"
</li>
<li>Catch underlying "heartbleed" problem, so that nothing bad
happens even when using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.
</li>
<li>Add locking API for sql_null, linelog, and detail modules,
which should improve performance and work around issues
on platforms with bad file locking.
</li>
<li>Allow DHCP NAKs to be delayed, via setting
reply:FreeRADIUS-Response-Delay = 1
</li>
<li>Allow tag and array references anywhere attributes
are allowed in "unlang".
</li>
<li>many enhancements to radsniff, including output
to collectd, ipv6 support and packet loss statistics.
</li>
<li>Many dictionary updates (ZTE, Brocade, Motorola).
</li>
<li>rlm_yubikey now automatically splits passwords from OTP
strings.
</li>
<li>The detail file reader is now threaded by default.
This should improve performance reading the files.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix xlat expression %{attribute[n]} so that it actually
returns the n'th attribute instead of the first one.
</li>
<li>Don't parse string on RHS of update {} when using unary
operators (!*).  The RHS should always be ignored.
</li>
<li>Check for more optional functions in json-c so we can
Build with libjson0, which is the name of the json-c package
on debian/ubuntu.
</li>
<li>Fix issue in radmin where the main dictionaries would
not be loaded which, depending on the configuration, may
have caused validation errors.
</li>
<li>Fix handling of "%{reply:3GPP-*}"
</li>
<li>Fix rlm_perl garbage attributes
</li>
<li>Fix oracle SQL queries, which amongst other things still
used the old expansion format, which is no longer
supported/parsed.
</li>
<li>Truncate long format strings and error markers instead of
omitting them.
</li>
<li>Fix multiple attribute parsing in rlm_rest JSON.
</li>
<li>Don't crash in rlm_rest if connect_uri is commented out
in the configuration.
</li>
<li>Don't double-escape strings to / from Perl.  You may need
to double-check your Perl scripts if they use "\" characters.
See mods-available/perl for documentation.
</li>
<li>Don't re-run "authorize" if a home server fails to respond.
</li>
<li>Don't append "0x" to hex output of octets types, for xlat
expansions.  This is the same as v2, and makes it easier
to concatenate multiple attributes of type "octets"
</li>
<li>FreeBSD fixes for execinfo linking.
</li>
<li>Make some of the module configurations more consistent.
</li>
<li>Fix corner cases where STDOUT wouldn't be closed in
daemon mode.
</li>
<li>Re-enable "update coa" and originating CoA requests.
</li>
<li>Prevent multiple threads writing to the sql query logs.
</li>
<li>Fix zombie period calculation.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/579">579</a>
</li>
<li>Properly parent VPs for talloc, when moving them in map2request.
</li>
<li>Various fixes for talloc parent / child relationships
</li>
<li>Allow rlm_counter to support VSAs.
</li>
<li>Normalize return codes for many modules. "do nothing" is noop,
not "ok".
</li>
<li>Run Post-Proxy-Type Fail.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/576">576</a>
</li>
<li>Fix DHCP destination port for replies to relays.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/591">591</a>
</li>
<li>Do-Not-Respond policy works again  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/593">593</a>
</li>
<li>Proxy-To-Virtual-Server works again.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/596">596</a>
</li>
<li>Build fixes for ancient systems.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/607">607</a>, #608, #609.
</li>
<li>%{Module-Return-Code} works again.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/610">610</a>.
</li>
<li>Don't increment statistics for Status-Server responses.
Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/612">612</a>.
</li>
<li>A duplicate request isn't a duplicate if the original one
is marked "done".  This should lower retransmissions from
clients.
</li>
<li>Fix multiple regular expression and glob memory leaks.
</li>
<li>Don't allocate any memory in fr_fault() as it can cause malloc
to deadlock.
</li>
<li>Temporarily set dumpable flag before calling system in fr_fault()
else the debugger may not be able to attach.
</li>
<li>Set nonblock on all TCP client sockets.
</li>
<li>Fix minor buffer overrun in mschapv2 where some attribute strings
were not correctly \0 terminated.
</li>
<li>Fix crash on authentication failure with MIT kerberos.
</li>
<li>Fix code so that octal escape sequences aren't prematurely unescaped
in rlm_sql, radclient, preprocess, and other places. This may
require configuration changes, as these sequences will no longer
need double escaping (\\) of the backslash.
</li>
<li>The connection pools no longer have one connection used twice
in certain rare conditions.
</li>
<li>Use self pipes for internal signals.  The code was there, but was
unused.
</li>
<li>Don't crash if there are outstanding EAP sessions and were told to
exit gracefully.
</li>
<li>Fix typo in dictionary.rfc4072
</li>
</ul>
