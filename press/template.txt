XYZ, Inc. Announces Widget to Maximize Customer Response Rate

This headline is one of the most important components of the press
release as this needs to "grab the attention" of the editor. It should
be in bold type and a font that is larger than the body
text. Preferred type fonts are Arial, Times New Roman, or
Verdana. Keep the headline to 80-125 characters maximum. Capitalize
every word with the exception of "a", "the" "an" or any word that is
three characters or less.

<City>, <State>, <Date> - Your first paragraph of the release should
be written in a clear and concise manner. The opening sentence
contains the most important information; keep it to 25 words or
less. Never take for granted that the reader has read your
headline. It needs contain information that will "entice" the
reader. Remember, your story must be newsworthy and factual; don't
make it a sales pitch or it will end up in the trash.

Answer the questions "who", "what", "when", "where", "why" and
"how". Your text should include pertinent information about your
product, service or event. If writing about a product, make sure to
include details on when the product is available, where it can be
purchased and the cost. If you're writing about an event, include the
date, location of the event and any other pertinent information. You
should include a quote from someone that is a credible source of
information; include their title or position with the company, and why
they are considered a credible source. Always include information on
any awards they have won, articles they've published or interviews
they have given.

Keep your sentences and paragraphs short; a paragraph should be no
more than 3-4 sentences. Your release should be between 500 to 800
words, written in a word processing program, and spell checked for
errors. Don't forget to proofread for grammatical errors. The mood of
the release should be factual, not hyped; don't use a sales pitch as
it will ruin your credibility with the reader.

The last paragraph before the company information should read: For
additional information on (put in the subject of this release),
contact "name" or visit www.yoururl.com. If you offer a sample, copy
or demo, put the information in here. You can also include details on
product availability, trademark acknowledgment, etc. in this area of
the release.
