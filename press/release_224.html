<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>A "panic_action" can be set to have the server dump a gdb
log on SEGV or other fatal error.
</li>
<li>allow radmin command "set module status &lt;module&gt; &lt;code&gt;"
which can be used to forcibly enable/disable modules.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the server fails to bind() after fork(), that is now
reported to the parent, which exits with an error.
</li>
<li>Session / delay times in MySQL are unsigned int.
</li>
<li>Use --tag=CC for libtool.  Closes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/497">497</a>.  Because libtool
is too stupid to notice that compiling means compilation.
</li>
<li>Fix bug when copying attributes for vendors &gt; 32767
</li>
<li>Fix behaviour on FreeBSD where sending packets from an interface
bound to an IP address would fail when the server was built with
udpfromto.
</li>
<li>Don't fail config check if were listening on an IP which is
also a home server. Some deployments have valid reasons
to loop packets back to another virtual server.
</li>
<li>Use correct port when DHCP relaying.
</li>
<li>Set source IP address for DHCP packets from DHCP-Server-IP-Address,
or DHCP-DHCP-Server-Identifier, if we're unable to otherwise
determine the source IP.
</li>
</ul>
