<h3>Feature improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>100% configuration file compatible with 2.1.x.
  The only fix needed is to disallow "hashsize=0" for rlm_passwd</li>
<li>Update Aruba, Alcatel Lucent, APC, BT, PaloAlto, Pureware,
  Redback, and Mikrotik dictionaries</li>
<li>Switch to using SHA1 for certificate digests instead of MD5.
  See raddb/certs/*.cnf</li>
<li>Added copyright statements to the dictionaries, so that we know
  when people are using them.</li>
<li>Better documentation for radrelay and detail file writer.
  See raddb/modules/radrelay and raddb/radrelay.conf</li>
<li>Added TLS-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Email from patch by Luke Howard</li>
<li>Added -F <file> to radwho</li>
<li>Added query timeouts to MySQL driver.  Patch from Brian De Wolf.</li>
<li>Add /etc/default/freeradius to debian package.
  Patch from Matthew Newton</li>
<li>Finalize DHCP and DHCP relay code.  It should now work everywhere.
  See raddb/sites-available/dhcp, src_ipaddr and src_interface.</li>
<li>DHCP capabilitiies are now compiled in by default.
  It runs as a DHCP server ONLY when manually enabled.</li>
<li>Added one letter expansions: %G - request minute and %I request
  ID.</li>
<li>Added script to convert ISC DHCP lease files to SQL pools.
  See scripts/isc2ippool.pl</li>
<li>Added rlm_cache to cache arbitrary attributes.</li>
<li>Added max_use to rlm_ldap to force connection to be re-established
  after a given number of queries.</li>
<li>Added configtest option to Debian init scripts, and automatic
  config test on restart.</li>
<li>Added cache config item to rlm_krb5. When set to "no" ticket
  caching is disabled which may increase performance.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix CVE-2012-3547.  All users of 2.1.10, 2.1.11, 2.1.12,
  and 802.1X should upgrade immediately.</li>
<li>Fix typo in detail file writer, to skip writing if the packet
  was read from this detail file.</li>
<li>Free cached replies when closing resumed SSL sessions.</li>
<li>Fix a number of issues found by Coverity.</li>
<li>Fix memory leak and race condition in the EAP-TLS session cache.
  Thanks to Phil Mayers for tracking down OpenSSL APIs.</li>
<li>Restrict ATTRIBUTE names to character sets that make sense.</li>
<li>Fix EAP-TLS session Id length so that OpenSSL doesn't get
  excited.</li>
<li>Fix SQL IPPool logic for non-timer attributes.  Closes bug #181</li>
<li>Change some informational messages to DEBUG rather than error.</li>
<li>Portability fixes for FreeBSD.  Closes bug #177</li>
<li>A much better fix for the _lt__PROGRAM__LTX_preloaded_symbols
  nonsense.</li>
<li>Safely handle extremely long lines in conf file variable expansion</li>
<li>Fix for Debian bug #606450</li>
<li>Mutex lock around rlm_perl Clone routines. Patch from Eike Dehling</li>
<li>The passwd module no longer permits "hashsize = 0".  Setting that
  is pointless for a host of reasons.  It will also break the server.</li>
<li>Fix proxied inner-tunnel packets sometimes having zero authentication
  vector.  Found by Brian Julin.</li>
<li>Added $(EXEEXT) to Makefiles for portability.  Closes bug #188.</li>
<li>Fix minor build issue which would cause rlm_eap to be built twice.</li>
<li>When using "status_check=request" for a home server, the username
  and password must be specified, or the server will not start.</li>
<li>EAP-SIM now calculates keys from the SIM identity, not from the
  EAP-Identity.  Changing the EAP type via NAK may result in
  identities changing.  Bug reported by Microsoft EAP team.</li>
<li>Use home server src_ipaddr when sending Status-Server packets</li>
<li>Decrypt encrypted ERX attributes in CoA packets.</li>
<li>Fix registration of internal xlat's so %{mschap:...} doesn't
  disappear after a HUP.</li>
<li>Can now reference tagged attributes in expansions.
  e.g. %{Tunnel-Type:1} and %{Tunnel-Type:1[0]} now work.</li>
<li>Correct calculation of Message-Authenticator for CoA and Disconnect
  replies.  Patch from Jouni Malinen</li>
<li>Install rad_counter, for managing rlm_counter files.</li>
<li>Add unique index constraint to all SQL flavours so that alternate
  queries work correctly.</li>
<li>The TTLS diameter decoder is now more lenient.  It ignores
  unknown attributes, instead of rejecting the TTLS session.</li>
<li>Use "globfree" in detail file reader.  Prevents very slow leak.
  Closes bug #207.</li>
<li>Operator =~ shouldn't copy the attribute, like :=.  It should
  instead behave more like ==.</li>
<li>Build main Debian package without SQL dependencies</li>
<li>Use max_queue_size in threading code</li>
<li>Update permissions in raddb/sql/postgresql/admin.sql</li>
<li>Added OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() to fix issues where OpenSSL
  wouldn't use methods it knew about.</li>
<li>Add more sanity checks in dynamic_clients code so the server won't
  crash if it attempts to load a badly formated client definition.</li>
</ul>
