run-time a bit faster.

module authors will have to do the same.
</li>
<li>More documentation on contributing and how to write
modules.
</li>
<li>Update radiusd.service for systemd.
</li>
<li>Open IPv6 proxy socket if the server is listening on IPV6
auth / acct / coa packets.
</li>
<li>Create debian packages for DHCP.  Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/1125">1125</a>.
</li>
<li>Add more tests for &quot;update&quot; section parsing.
</li>
<li>Update &quot;man&quot; pages.
</li>
<li>Update attributes for Alcatel 7750
</li>
<li>Add dictionary for Boingo Wi-Fi
</li>
<li>Add support for DHCP lease queries.
See raddb/sites-available/dhcp
</li>
<li>On HUP, check all modules for config files which have
changed.  And only re-load those modules.

<li>Don't crash when doing &quot;radmin -e &quot;help hup&quot;.
Patch from Matthew Newton.
</li>
<li>The dictionary parser now does more sanity checks, which
prevents run-time problems with invalid attributes.
</li>
<li>Update debian packages.  Patches from Christopher Hoskin.
</li>
<li>Many other debian packaging fixes from Matthew Netwon
and Herwin Weststrate.
</li>
<li>Add &quot;session-state&quot; to Perl.  Patch from Herwin Weststrate.

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix rlm_files so that there are no collisions when loading
10's of 1000's of users.
</li>
<li>Fix radclient to use our internal v4/v6 parsing functions.
v6 addresses with ports now work correctly.
</li>
<li>Fix sending/receiving packet messages to wrap v6 addresses
in square brackets '[]'.
</li>
<li>Check for sasl/sasl.h when building rlm_ldap, and disable
SASL functionality if unavailable.
</li>
<li>Fix issue which caused a non \0 terminated buffer to be
assigned to attributes if the value being assigned contained
an invalid escape sequence.
</li>
<li>Fix deadlock when reconnecting connections in the connection
pool.
</li>
<li>Fix potential overrun in functions that used fr_utf8_char
with a non nul terminated buffer.
</li>
<li>Fix decoding issue for Tunnel-Password type attributes
which were very long.  Found by Denis Andzakovic.
</li>
<li>Fix radclient issue with TCP sockets on FreeBSD.
</li>
<li>The server now creates ${run_dir} and ${logdir} directories
in daemon mode, when running as &quot;root&quot;.
</li>
<li>Handle tags when using maps.  Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/1191">1191</a>.
</li>
<li>Fix crash when CoA packets time out.
</li>
<li>Fix parse error in rediswho
</li>
<li>Fix regex support in SQL radcheck the &quot;users&quot; file and radsniff.
</li>
<li>Register listen xlat earlier, so that it's available when the
virtual servers are being parsed.
</li>
<li>Parse Ascend-Data-Filter when given as &quot;0x...&quot;
</li>
<li>Print Ascend-Data-Filter correctly.  Add test cases for both.
</li>
<li>Allow old-style clients again.  They will be disallowed for
3.1.0 and following.
</li>
<li>Complain instead of crash when &quot;else&quot; and &quot;elsif&quot; are in
the wrong place.
</li>
<li>Clean up memory more aggressively.  This lowers the
maximum memory used, most typically for TLS based EAP methods.
</li>
<li>Prevent the server from unlinking the control socket of an
already running instance.
</li>
<li>Fallback to using the configured OCSP URL if one exists, and
no URL is provided in the certificate.
</li>
<li>Return CoA-NAK if proxying CoA fails.  Based on patch from
Jorge Pereira.
</li>
<li>Lower peak memory usage by decreasing size of internal
memory pools.
</li>
<li>The control socket is now left in place if a second copy
of the server is accidentally started.
</li>
<li>Allow virtual attributes in &quot;switch&quot;, &quot;case&quot;, etc.
Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/1240">1240</a> and #1265.
</li>
<li>Many spell check / typo fixes in comments and example
configuration files.
</li>
<li>Better handle multiple DHCP listeners.
</li>
<li>Don't print secrets for old-style realms.  Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/1267">1267</a>.
</li>
<li>Don't fall through in empty &quot;case&quot; statements.
Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/1274">1274</a>.
</li>
<li>Update EAP-TTLS so that MPPE keys are correctly calculated with TLSv1.2.
</li>
<li>Always delete MS-MPPE-* from the TTLS inner tunnel. This allows
TTLS / EAP-MSCHAPv2 to work. Fixes #<a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/issues/1206">1206</a>.
</li>
<li>Fix off by one error that caused some MSCHAP-Error messages to
be sent without the password change version (V=3) and the textual
message component (M=).
</li>
<li>Always include C= V= and M= in MSCHAPv2 errors.  RFC 2759 does not say
that any of these fields are optional, and not including V= caused
errors with wpa_supplicant.
</li>
<li>Do not include M= in MSCHAPv1 errors.  It's not supported.
</li>
</ul>
