<dt><span class="date">December 18, 2007</span> - <b><a
name="rfc5080">RFC 5080</a> has been issued.</b> </dt>

<dd><p>After a long wait, <a
href="http://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5080.txt">RFC 5080</a> has been
issued, with the title <em>Common RADIUS Implementation Issues and
Suggested Fixes</em>.  FreeRADIUS has contributed heavily to this
document, as <a href="/about.html#alan.dekok">Alan DeKok</a> (Project
Leader), is a co-author.  In Section 2.1.2, the document describes a
way of handling EAP sessions that was first developed in FreeRADIUS.
In addition to the document standardizing this method, all RADIUS
servers (commercial and open source) have been using this method since
FreeRADIUS first developed it.</p>

<p>We are pleased to see the publication of this document.  It further
defines FreeRADIUS as the <a href="/press/survey.html">industry
leading</a> RADIUS server.  It also defines FreeRADIUS as the product
which is setting the standards followed by the rest of the
industry.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="date">December 1, 2007</span> - <b>A Development
Roadmap is announced</b> </dt>

<dd><p>As part of the continued growth of the server, we are actively
<a href="business/roadmap.html">looking for sponsors</a> for new
features.  New projects include support for WiMAX, 3GPP2, Change of
Authorization (CoA), Windows ports, etc.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="date">August 29, 2007</span> - <b>FreeRADIUS <a
name="freeradius-server-2.0.0-pre2">2.0.0-pre2</a> has been released.</b></dt>

<dd><p>This is the second "pre" release of what will become version
2.0.0 of the FreeRADIUS server.  Please download it and test it, to
ensure that any issues are caught before the final 2.0.0
release.  The notable changes between 2.0.0-pre1 and 2.0.0-pre2 are:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a new policy "language" that makes it trivial to implement almost every policy.  See <tt>man unlang</tt> for comprehensive documentation.</li>
<li><tt>radrelay</tt> functionality has been improved.  You can now limit the rate at which new requests are read from the <tt>detail</tt> file.  Please test and comment on any issues you see.
<li>Virtual server support (like Apache).  See <tt>raddb/sites-available</tt> and <tt>raddb/sites-enabled</tt></li>
<ul>
<li>Multiple virtual servers may be configured.  Each one can have local policies that do not affect any other virtual servers.</a>
<li>An IP address / port can be statically tied to one virtual server.</li>
<li>An IP address / port can be dynamically directed to a virtual server</li>
<li>Inner tunnel EAP sessions can be statically tied to one one virtual server.</li>
<li>Inner tunnel EAP sessions can be dynamically directed to a virtual server.</li>
<li>Each virtual server can have its own, private, list of clients.</li>
<li>One client can be listed in multiple virtual servers, possibly with a different shared secret for each server.</a>
</ul>
<li>The biggest change from earlier versions of FreeRADIUS is that at
least one default virtual server <b>must</b> be used.  If you are
upgrading from a previous version of FreeRADIUS, this change can be
done by editing <tt>radiusd.conf</tt>, and wrapping all of the
<tt>authorize</tt>, <tt>authenticate</tt>, etc. sections in one
<tt>server</tt> block, as follows:

<ul>
<pre>
  server {	# line to add
	authorize {
		...
	}
	authenticate {
		...
	}
	accounting {
		...
	}
	...
	post-proxy {
		...
	}
  }  		# matching line to add
</pre>
</ul>

<p>If this change is not made, the server <b>will not start</b>.</p></li>

<li>The changes from 1.x to 2.0.0-pre1 are outlined below in the <a
href="#freeradius-server-2.0.0-pre1">2.0.0-pre1</a> release
announcement.</li>

<li>There are a few known issues with 2.0.0-pre2 that should be fixed
before the final 2.0.0 release.  These issues are:

<ul>
<li>HUP handling still doesn't work well.  A proposal to use RTA was <a href="http://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-devel/2007-July/011579.html">posted to the mailing list</a>.  Please comment if you have any opinions.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

</dd>

<dt><span class="date">July 25, 2007</span> - <b>Version <a
name="1.1.7">1.1.7</a> has been released.</b> </dt>

<dd><p>The focus of this release is stability.  A number of bugs that
found in 1.1.6 have been fixed.  Some features have been added,
including support for stored procedures in MySQL.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="date">May 16, 2007</span> - <b>FreeRADIUS <a
name="freeradius-server-2.0.0-pre1">2.0.0-pre1</a> has been released.</b>.
</dt>

<dd><p>This is the first "pre" release of what will become version
2.0.0 of the FreeRADIUS server.  Please download it and test it, to
ensure that any issues are caught before the final 2.0.0
release.</p>

<p>It has been almost three years since 1.0.0 was released, and it's
high time for the release of the next major version of the server.
The notable changes between 1.x and 2.x are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.</li>
<li>EAP-TLS and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
    See raddb/certs/README for details.</li>
<li>Proxying works much better than in 1.x.  We mean <em>much</em> better.
    See proxy.conf for details.</li>
<li>rlm_unix no longer has an "authenticate" section.
    See "man rlm_unix" for details.</li>
<li>The server has full support for IPv6.</li>
<li>The server has much more complete support for SNMP MIBs.</li>
<li>"listen" sections can have per-socket clients.</li>
<li>Replaced "radrelay" and "radsqlrelay".
See "man radrelay.conf" for details.</li>
<li>Post-Proxy-Type "Fail" section is executed when a home server
fails to respond to a request.  See "radiusd.conf" for details.</li>
<li>Configuration files CANNOT be copied directly from 1.x. Some may work, most will require careful porting.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few known issues with 2.0.0-pre1 that will be fixed
before the final 2.0.0 release.  These issues are:</p>

<ul>
<li>HUP handling still isn't correct.  Almost anything may happen
on HUP.</li>
<li>The "radrelay" integration into the server is not yet finalized
<br />Reading the detail files will work, mostly.</li>
</ul>

<dd><p>A number of industry vendors are working to create a commercial
organization behind an Open Source supplicant.  We suspect that the supplicant will work well with a <a href="/press/survey.html">popular</a> RADIUS server.</p></dd>


<dt><span class="date">April 16, 2007</span> - <b>PAM Module version <a

<dd><p>The number of allowed retries has been increased.  A
<code>ruser</code> option has been added, to authenticate as
<code>PAM_RUSER</code> instead of <code>PAM_USER</code>, to allow
applications such as 'su' to authenticate as the real user.  Patch
from David Mitchell.  Also, 'localifdown' option was added, that
causes the module to return <code>PAM_IGNORE</code> if there are no
live RADIUS servers.</p></dd>
